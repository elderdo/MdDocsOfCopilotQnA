### question

When using PowerShell and doing a search for a file how do you redirect stderr to a dummy file like NUL for Windows batch scripts?

### answer

To redirect `stderr` to a dummy file like `NUL` in PowerShell, you can use the following command:

```powershell
<command> 2> $null
```

This will redirect the error output (`stderr`) to `$null`, which is the PowerShell equivalent of `NUL` in Windows batch scripts.
