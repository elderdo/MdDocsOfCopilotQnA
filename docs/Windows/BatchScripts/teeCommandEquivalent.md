### question

Using a .bat Windows batch script file what is the equivalent way of mimicing the function of the Linux tee command? Is a C# application required? If yes, can you write the code for it?

### answer

You can mimic the functionality of the Linux `tee` command in a Windows batch script without needing a C# application. Here's how you can do it:

```batch
@echo off
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion

rem Define the output file
set output_file=output.txt

rem Clear the output file
> %output_file% echo.

rem Loop through the command output
for /f "delims=" %%a in ('your_command_here') do (
    echo %%a
    echo %%a >> %output_file%
)
```

Replace `your_command_here` with the command you want to run. This script will display the command output on the console and write it to `output.txt` simultaneously.

If you still prefer a C# application, here's a simple example:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.IO;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string command = "your_command_here";
        string outputFile = "output.txt";

        ProcessStartInfo psi = new ProcessStartInfo("cmd.exe", "/c " + command)
        {
            RedirectStandardOutput = true,
            UseShellExecute = false,
            CreateNoWindow = true
        };

        using (Process process = Process.Start(psi))
        using (StreamReader reader = process.StandardOutput)
        using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(outputFile))
        {
            string line;
            while ((line = reader.ReadLine()) != null)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(line);
                writer.WriteLine(line);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Replace `your_command_here` with the command you want to run. This C# application will execute the command, display the output on the console, and write it to `output.txt`.
