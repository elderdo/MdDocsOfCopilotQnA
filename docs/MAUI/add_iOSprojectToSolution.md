### question
Does VS 2022 have a MAUI iOS project template that can easily be added to a MAUI solution? 

### answer
Yes, Visual Studio 2022 includes templates for creating .NET MAUI projects, which can target multiple platforms, including iOS. When you create a new .NET MAUI project, it automatically includes support for iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS.

To add a MAUI iOS project to your solution:

1. **Create a New MAUI Project**:
   - Open Visual Studio 2022.
   - Select **Create a new project**.
   - Search for **MAUI** and select the **.NET MAUI App** template.
   - Follow the prompts to configure your new project.

2. **Configure iOS Settings**:
   - In the Solution Explorer, you will see a **Platforms** folder with subfolders for **Android**, **iOS**, **MacCatalyst**, and **Windows**.
   - You can add platform-specific code in the **iOS** folder.

3. **Build and Run**:
   - Ensure you have the necessary tools installed for iOS development, such as Xcode on a Mac.
   - Connect to a Mac build host if you're developing on Windows.
   - Select the iOS target and run your application.
