Could you write an app that reads in a dictionary of name value pairs from a text file and then reads another text file replaces all text contained in braces matching a dictionary key with the value for that key and remove the braces surrounding the key? This would be similar to how C# interpolates strings.

Sure, here's a simple console application in C# that does what you're asking for. This application assumes that the dictionary file contains one key-value pair per line, separated by a comma, and that the text file contains the text to be replaced.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Read the dictionary file
        var dictionary = File.ReadLines("dictionary.txt")
            .Select(line => line.Split(','))
            .ToDictionary(parts => parts[0], parts => parts[1]);

        // Read the text file
        var text = File.ReadAllText("text.txt");

        // Replace the text
        foreach (var kvp in dictionary)
        {
            // Use regex to match the keys surrounded by braces
            var pattern = $"\\{{{kvp.Key}\\}}";
            text = Regex.Replace(text, pattern, kvp.Value);
        }

        // Write the result to a new file
        File.WriteAllText("result.txt", text);
    }
}
```

This program reads the dictionary from a file named `dictionary.txt`, reads the text from a file named `text.txt`, replaces all occurrences of the keys in the dictionary (surrounded by braces) with their corresponding values in the text, and writes the result to a file named `result.txt`.

Please replace `"dictionary.txt"`, `"text.txt"`, and `"result.txt"` with the paths to your actual files. Also, ensure that the necessary `System.IO`, `System.Linq`, and `System.Text.RegularExpressions` namespaces are included in your project. If you're running this in a .NET Core or .NET 5+ application, you may need to add the `System.Linq` package to your project using the `dotnet add package System.Linq` command.

Remember to handle exceptions and edge cases as needed for your specific use case. This is a basic example and may not cover all possible scenarios. For example, you might want to handle the case where the dictionary or text file does not exist, or where the dictionary file contains lines that don't have exactly one comma. You might also want to consider performance implications if the dictionary or text file is very large.
