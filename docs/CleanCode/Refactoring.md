### For C# what type of code needs refactoring? Are there tutorials or videos that explain how to make clean code refactoring it in Visual Studio? Does Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code have any extensions or AI that assist with refactoring?

In C#, code refactoring is often needed when you encounter the following scenarios⁴⁵:

1. **Extract Method**: When a portion of code can be isolated into its method.
2. **Rename**: When a variable or method's name doesn't reflect its purpose.
3. **Remove Duplication**: When repeated code can be consolidated into a shared function or class.
4. **Replace Type Code with Class/Subclasses/State/Strategy**: When type codes can be replaced with more object-oriented structures.
5. **Simplify Conditional Expressions**: When complex conditional expressions can be simplified for readability.

For tutorials and videos on how to refactor C# code in Visual Studio, you can check out the following resources:

1. [Refactoring with C# and Visual Studio](^6^): A video tutorial on how to refactor C# code in Visual Studio 2022.
2. [Refactoring Your C# Code Just Got Easier - Use This Strategy!](^7^): A video tutorial on using composition to refactor C# code.
3. [C# Quick Actions and Refactorings in Visual Studio Code](^1^): A guide on how to refactor your source code in Visual Studio Code.
4. [Refactoring source code in Visual Studio Code](^10^): A guide on refactoring support in Visual Studio Code.

Visual Studio 2022 and VS Code do have extensions and AI tools that assist with refactoring:

1. **IntelliCode**: Built into Visual Studio, IntelliCode improves upon the code-completion capabilities of IntelliSense by scanning thousands of open-source GitHub repos to find the most likely code snippets and place them at the top of the recommendation list¹²¹³.
2. **GitHub Copilot**: An AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with greater accuracy. It can generate whole lines or blocks of code based on the context provided by you¹²¹³.
3. **Tabnine AI Autocomplete**: An AI code assistant that provides whole-line code completions, full-function completions, and natural language to code completions¹².
4. **OpenRefactor AI**: An extension for Visual Studio Code that uses AI to refactor your code¹⁴.

Remember to always test your code thoroughly after refactoring to ensure that the functionality remains intact.
