### question

I am getting this error for a gitbash terminal:
Error: error getting git config for 'git-together.active'
Caused by: config value 'git-together.active' was not found; class=Config (7); code=NotFound (-3)

Do you have any suggestions on how to fix this error?

### answer

To fix the error related to `git-together.active` in your Git Bash terminal, you can try the following steps:

1. **Check Configuration**: Ensure that the `git-together` configuration is correctly set up. You can add the necessary configuration using the following commands:

   ```bash
   git config --global --add git-together.active <your-active-config>
   ```

2. **Add Authors**: If you haven't added any authors, you can do so with:

   ```bash
   git config --global --add git-together.authors.<initials> "<Name>; <email>"
   ```

3. **Include Configuration File**: Make sure the `.git-together` file is included in your global configuration:

   ```bash
   git config --global --add include.path ~/.git-together
   ```

4. **Verify Configuration**: Check your configuration to ensure it includes the necessary settings:
   ```bash
   git config --list
   ```

These steps should help resolve the issue with the `git-together.active` configuration¹⁵.
