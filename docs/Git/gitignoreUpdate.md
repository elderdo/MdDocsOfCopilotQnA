### question
For git I want to ignore any file with a .tlog extension. how do I do that?

### answer
To ignore any file with a .tlog extension in git, you'll need to add an entry in your .gitignore file. Hereâ€™s what you do:

## Open or Create the .gitignore file in the root directory of your repository.

1. Add the following line to ignore all .tlog files:

```plaintext
*.tlog
```
2. Save the file and close it.

This tells git to ignore any files with a .tlog extension in your repository. Simple, right? If you need more customization or run into any issues, I'm here to help! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€

### statement
I tried that. It didn't work. it stills shows those files as modified

### solution
Got it. Sometimes, .gitignore doesn't immediately catch files already being tracked. Hereâ€™s what you do:

1. Add to .gitignore: Ensure youâ€™ve added *.tlog correctly:

```plaintext
*.tlog
```
2. Remove Files from Tracking: This stops git from tracking these files:

```shell
git rm --cached *.tlog
```

3. Commit Changes:

```shell
git commit -m "Stop tracking .tlog files"

```

Now, git should properly ignore those pesky .tlog files. Give that a shot! If you hit any bumps, Iâ€™m here. ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
