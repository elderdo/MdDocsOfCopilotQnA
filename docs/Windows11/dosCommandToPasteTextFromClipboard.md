### question

How do you paste text from the Windows clipboard with a dos command?

### answer

To paste text from the Windows clipboard using a DOS command, you can use the `clip` command. Here's how you can do it:

### Using `clip` Command

1. **Copy Text to Clipboard**: First, ensure the text you want to paste is copied to the clipboard.

2. **Paste Text from Clipboard**: Use the following command to paste the clipboard content into a file or another command.

   - **To paste into a file**:

     ```sh
     clip < filename.txt
     ```

   - **To paste into another command**:
     ```sh
     some_command | clip
     ```

### Example

If you have some text copied to the clipboard and you want to paste it into a file named `output.txt`, you can use:

```sh
clip < output.txt
```

Or, if you want to sort the clipboard content and then paste it back to the clipboard, you can use:

```sh
clip | sort | clip
```

This will sort the content of the clipboard and then copy the sorted content back to the clipboard.
