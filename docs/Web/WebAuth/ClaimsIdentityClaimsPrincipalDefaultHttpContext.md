var identity = new ClaimsIdentity(userClaims, "TestAuthType");
var claimsPrincipal = new ClaimsPrincipal(identity);
var httpContext = new DefaultHttpContext

I don't fully understand these three classes: Claimsprincipal, ClaimsIdentity, and Defaulthttpcontext. Can you explain in more detail what these three classes do and how they are typically used?

**ClaimsIdentity**:

- Represents a user's identity with a collection of claims (e.g., name, role).
- Used to create a user's identity in authentication and authorization processes.
- Example: `var identity = new ClaimsIdentity(userClaims, "TestAuthType");`

**ClaimsPrincipal**:

- Represents the security context of the user, including their identity and claims.
- Can contain multiple `ClaimsIdentity` objects.
- Example: `var claimsPrincipal = new ClaimsPrincipal(identity);`

**DefaultHttpContext**:

- Represents the context of an HTTP request in ASP.NET Core.
- Provides access to request and response objects, user information, and other HTTP-specific data.
- Example: `var httpContext = new DefaultHttpContext { User = claimsPrincipal };`

These classes are typically used in ASP.NET Core for handling user authentication and authorization, ensuring that the application can identify and authorize users based on their claims¹²³.
