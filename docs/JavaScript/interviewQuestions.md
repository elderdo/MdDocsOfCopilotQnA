3. Algorithms:

    - Q: Write a function to find the longest common prefix in an array of strings.

    - Q: How do you implement a binary search algorithm in JavaScript?

## Sample Question and Explanation
Q: What is a closure, and can you provide an example?

A: A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the scope of the outer function, and the global scope. Closures are created whenever a function is created, at function creation time.

Example:
```javascript
function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
  return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
    console.log('Outer variable:', outerVariable);
    console.log('Inner variable:', innerVariable);
  };
}

const newFunction = outerFunction('outside');
newFunction('inside');

// Output:
// Outer variable: outside
// Inner variable: inside
```

In this example, innerFunction is a closure that captures the outerVariable from outerFunction's scope.

Best Practices for Using Promises
1. Always Return Promises: Ensure that functions performing asynchronous operations return promises.

2. Avoid Nesting Promises: Use chaining to avoid callback hell.

3. Handle Errors Gracefully: Use .catch to handle errors and prevent unhandled promise rejections.

4. Use async/await: When possible, use async/await for more readable and maintainable code.

5. Parallel Execution: Use Promise.all for running multiple promises in parallel.

6. Graceful Degradation: Provide fallback mechanisms for handling errors and failed promises.

By understanding and practicing these concepts, you'll be well-prepared for JavaScript interview questions and demonstrate a strong grasp of the language and its features.

### Cheat Sheet
Fundamental Concepts
What are the different data types in JavaScript?

Answer: JavaScript has several data types, including:

Primitive types: undefined, null, boolean, number, string, bigint, and symbol.

Non-primitive types: object (which includes arrays, functions, and objects).

How do var, let, and const differ in JavaScript?

Answer: var has function scope and is hoisted. let and const have block scope. const cannot be reassigned after its initial assignment, whereas let can. Unlike var, let and const are not hoisted to the top of their block.

What is the difference between function declarations and function expressions?

Answer: A function declaration is hoisted and can be used before it's defined. A function expression is not hoisted and can only be used after it's defined. Example of a function declaration: function myFunction() { }. Example of a function expression: const myFunction = function() { };.

How do you create an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)?

Answer: An IIFE is a function that runs as soon as it is defined. You can create it by wrapping a function in parentheses and then immediately invoking it:
```javascript
(function() {
  console.log("IIFE executed!");
})();
```

What is the difference between global scope and local scope?

Answer: Global scope refers to variables that are accessible anywhere in the code. Local scope refers to variables that are only accessible within the function or block they are defined in.

Explain hoisting in JavaScript.

Answer: Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means you can use variables and functions before they are declared. However, only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.

What is a closure, and how do you use it?

Answer: A closure is a function that retains access to its outer scope even after the outer function has returned. Closures are created whenever a function is created, at function creation time. They are useful for data encapsulation and creating private variables.
```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  let outerVariable = "outer";
  return function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable);
  };
}
const inner = outerFunction();
inner(); // Logs: "outer"
```

Object-Oriented Programming
What is a prototype in JavaScript?

Answer: A prototype is an object from which other objects inherit properties and methods. Every JavaScript object has a prototype. Objects can access the properties and methods defined on their prototype via the prototype chain.

How does inheritance work in JavaScript?

Answer: Inheritance in JavaScript works through prototypes. When an object property or method is accessed, the JavaScript engine first looks for it on the object itself. If not found, it looks up the prototype chain until it finds the property or method or reaches the end of the chain.

How do you define a class in JavaScript?

Answer: A class in JavaScript can be defined using the class keyword. Classes are syntactic sugar over JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance.
```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
  }
}
const person = new Person("Alice");
person.greet(); // Logs: "Hello, my name is Alice"
```

Explain the difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance.

Answer: Classical inheritance is based on classes and is a blueprint-based approach seen in languages like Java. Prototypal inheritance, used in JavaScript, involves objects inheriting directly from other objects. Prototypes allow for dynamic inheritance and are more flexible than classical inheritance.

Asynchronous JavaScript
What is a Promise in JavaScript?

Answer: A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a more manageable way.

How do you handle asynchronous operations using Promises?

Answer: You can handle asynchronous operations using the .then, .catch, and .finally methods of a Promise. .then is used for successful resolution, .catch for errors, and .finally for final actions regardless of success or failure.
```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching data:', error))
  .finally(() => console.log('Fetch attempt completed'));
```

How do async and await work in JavaScript?

Answer: async and await provide a more readable and synchronous-looking way to handle asynchronous operations. An async function returns a promise, and await pauses the function execution until the promise is resolved or rejected.
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  }
}
fetchData();
```

What is a callback function?

Answer: A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of that function. They are used for handling asynchronous operations.
```javascript
function doSomethingAsync(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    callback("Done!");
  }, 1000);
}
doSomethingAsync((result) => {
  console.log(result); // Logs: "Done!"
});
```

How do you avoid callback hell?

Answer: You can avoid callback hell by using promises, async/await, or modularizing your code to make it more readable and maintainable.
```javascript
// Using promises
doSomethingAsync()
  .then(result => doSomethingElseAsync(result))
  .then(finalResult => console.log(finalResult))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));

// Using async/await
async function executeAsyncTasks() {
  try {
    const result = await doSomethingAsync();
    const finalResult = await doSomethingElseAsync(result);
    console.log(finalResult);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
executeAsyncTasks();
```

dvanced Topics
Explain the event loop in JavaScript.

Answer: The event loop is responsible for executing JavaScript code, handling events, and executing queued tasks. It allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations by offloading tasks to the web APIs and processing them asynchronously.

How do setTimeout and setInterval work with the event loop?

Answer: setTimeout schedules a function to be executed after a specified delay, while setInterval schedules a function to be executed repeatedly at specified intervals. Both use the event loop to handle the delayed execution.

How does garbage collection work in JavaScript?

Answer: Garbage collection in JavaScript is the process of automatically freeing memory by removing objects that are no longer accessible. The most common garbage collection algorithm is mark-and-sweep, which marks reachable objects and sweeps away unmarked objects.

What are memory leaks, and how do you prevent them?

Answer: Memory leaks occur when memory that is no longer needed is not released. They can be prevented by:

Avoiding global variables.

Clearing timers and event listeners when they are no longer needed.

Nullifying references to objects that are no longer used.

What are ES6 modules?

Answer: ES6 modules are a standardized module system in JavaScript. They allow you to import and export code between different files. ES6 modules are static, meaning the import and export statements are evaluated at parse time.
```javascript
// exporting a function
export function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}

// importing the function
import { greet } from './greet.js';
greet(); // Logs: "Hello, world!"
```

```

## Practical Coding Questions
1. Write a function to reverse a string.

- Answer:
```javascript
function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}
console.log(reverseString('hello')); // Logs: "olleh"
```

2. How do you remove duplicates from an array?

Answer:
```javascript
function removeDuplicates(arr) {
  return [...new Set(arr)];
}
console.log(removeDuplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 1])); // Logs: [1, 2, 3]
```
3. Algorithms
    - Longest Common Prefix
    To find the longest common prefix in an array of strings, we can follow this approach:

    - If the array is empty, return an empty string.

    - Sort the array. The longest common prefix will be a prefix of the first and last string in the sorted array.

    - Compare characters of the first and last string until a mismatch is found.

Here is the implementation in JavaScript:
```javascript
function longestCommonPrefix(strs) {
    if (strs.length === 0) return "";
    strs.sort();
    let first = strs[0];
    let last = strs[strs.length - 1];
    let i = 0;
    while (i < first.length && first[i] === last[i]) {
        i++;
    }
    return first.substring(0, i);
}

// Example usage
console.log(longestCommonPrefix(["flower", "flow", "flight"])); // Output: "fl"
console.log(longestCommonPrefix(["dog", "racecar", "car"])); // Output: ""
```

2. Binary Search Algorithm
Binary search is an efficient algorithm to find an element in a sorted array. The idea is to divide the array into halves and determine which half the target element lies in, then continue the search in that half. Repeat this process until the target element is found or the search space is empty.

Here is the implementation in JavaScript:
```javascript
function binarySearch(arr, target) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        if (arr[mid] === target) {
            return mid; // Target found
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1; // Search in the right half
        } else {
            right = mid - 1; // Search in the left half
        }
    }

    return -1; // Target not found
}

// Example usage
console.log(binarySearch([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 4)); // Output: 3
console.log(binarySearch([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 7)); // Output: -1
```
