### React Lifecycle Methods and Their Usage

React lifecycle methods are special methods in class components that allow you to hook into different stages of a component's lifecycle: mounting, updating, and unmounting. Here are some key lifecycle methods and examples of their usage:

#### **1. componentDidMount**
This method is called once, immediately after the component is added to the DOM. It's a good place to initiate network requests or set up subscriptions.

**Example:**
```javascript
class DataFetcher extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Data: {this.state.data}</div>;
  }
}

// Usage
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<DataFetcher />);
```
**Usage:**
- **DataFetcher Component**: Fetches data from an API when the component mounts and updates the state with the fetched data.

#### **2. shouldComponentUpdate**
This method is called before rendering when new props or state are received. It returns a boolean value that determines whether the component should re-render.

**Example:**
```javascript
class Counter extends React.Component {
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    return nextState.count !== this.state.count;
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Count: {this.state.count}</div>;
  }
}

// Usage
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Counter />);
```
**Usage:**
- **Counter Component**: Only re-renders if the `count` state changes, optimizing performance.

#### **3. componentDidUpdate**
This method is called immediately after updating occurs. It's useful for performing operations based on the previous state or props.

**Example:**
```javascript
class ScrollTracker extends React.Component {
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    if (this.props.scrollPosition !== prevProps.scrollPosition) {
      this.scrollToPosition();
    }
  }

  scrollToPosition() {
    window.scrollTo(0, this.props.scrollPosition);
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Scroll to: {this.props.scrollPosition}</div>;
  }
}

// Usage
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<ScrollTracker scrollPosition={100} />);
```
**Usage:**
- **ScrollTracker Component**: Scrolls to a new position when the `scrollPosition` prop changes.

#### **4. componentWillUnmount**
This method is called immediately before a component is removed from the DOM. It's a good place to clean up subscriptions or timers.

**Example:**
```javascript
class Timer extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(() => this.tick(), 1000);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }

  tick() {
    this.setState({ seconds: this.state.seconds + 1 });
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Seconds: {this.state.seconds}</div>;
  }
}

// Usage
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Timer />);
```
**Usage:**
- **Timer Component**: Sets up a timer when the component mounts and clears it when the component unmounts.

React lifecycle methods provide fine-grained control over component behavior, allowing developers to perform specific actions at different stages of a component's lifecycle²⁴⁵.
