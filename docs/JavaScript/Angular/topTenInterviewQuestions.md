### question
Can you give detail explanations for the ten most important features of Angular that are asked during a job interview and define terms or acronyms given in the explanations?

### answer
1. **Components**: Angular applications are built using components, which are the basic building blocks of the UI. Each component consists of an HTML template, a CSS stylesheet, and a TypeScript class that defines its behavior¹.

2. **Modules**: Angular modules (NgModules) are containers for a cohesive block of code dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a set of capabilities. They help in organizing an application into cohesive blocks of functionality¹.

3. **Templates**: Templates in Angular are written in HTML and contain Angular-specific syntax and directives to bind data and manage the DOM. They define the view for a component².

4. **Directives**: Directives are special markers in the DOM that tell Angular to do something to a DOM element (e.g., change its appearance, behavior, or layout). Common directives include `ngIf`, `ngFor`, and `ngClass`².

5. **Dependency Injection (DI)**: DI is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control), allowing a class to receive its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself. Angular's DI system helps manage the dependencies of components and services³.

6. **Services**: Services in Angular are used to share data and logic across multiple components. They are typically singleton objects that are instantiated once and used throughout the application¹.

7. **Routing**: Angular's Router module enables navigation between different views or components within a single-page application (SPA). It allows you to define routes and manage navigation¹.

8. **Forms**: Angular provides two approaches for handling user input through forms: Template-driven forms and Reactive forms. Template-driven forms are simple and use Angular directives, while Reactive forms are more powerful and use reactive programming principles¹.

9. **HTTPClient**: The `HttpClient` module is used for making HTTP requests to communicate with backend services. It supports features like interceptors, request and response handling, and error handling¹.

10. **Angular CLI**: The Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that helps in automating the development workflow. It can generate components, services, and modules, as well as handle tasks like testing, building, and deploying the application¹.
