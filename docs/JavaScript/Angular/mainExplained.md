## Explanation
```typescript
import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { appConfig } from './app/app.config';
import { AppComponent } from './app/app.component';

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig)
  .catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

1. Import Statements:

- import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';: This imports the bootstrapApplication function from the @angular/platform-browser package. This function is responsible for bootstrapping (starting up) the Angular application in the browser.

- import { appConfig } from './app/app.config';: This imports appConfig from your app.config file. appConfig likely contains configuration settings for your application.

- import { AppComponent } from './app/app.component';: This imports the root component (AppComponent) of your application from the app.component file.

2. Bootstrapping the Application:

- bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, appConfig): This function call bootstraps the Angular application. It takes two arguments:

    - AppComponent: The root component of your application, which will be the entry point.

    - appConfig: Configuration settings that might include providers, environment settings, or other configurations needed by the application.

- .catch((err) => console.error(err));: This is a promise catch handler that logs any errors that occur during the bootstrapping process to the console.

## Purpose of Each Part:
- bootstrapApplication: The main function to start the Angular application.

- AppComponent: The root component that serves as the entry point of the application.

- appConfig: Configuration settings to customize how the application is bootstrapped.

- Error Handling: The .catch block ensures that any errors during the bootstrapping process are caught and logged.

This setup ensures that your application is bootstrapped correctly with the specified configurations and handles any errors that might occur during the initialization.
