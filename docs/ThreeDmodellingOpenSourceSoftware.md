There are several open-source tools available for creating 3D models. Here are a few notable ones:

1. **Blender**¹: Blender is a free and open-source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation³. It offers a comprehensive array of modeling tools that make creating, transforming, and editing your models a breeze¹.

2. **3dfier**⁴: 3dfier is an open-source tool specifically designed for creating 3D models. It's hosted on GitHub and is used for GIS, lidar, and city modeling⁴.

3. **Daz 3D**⁵: Daz 3D is recommended as the best free 3D modeling software overall due to its massive library of pre-built elements, allowing users to assemble amazing characters and scenes quickly⁵.

4. **TinkerCAD**⁵: TinkerCAD is a great option for complete beginners. It's a simple, online 3D design and 3D printing app for everyone from beginners to professionals⁵.
