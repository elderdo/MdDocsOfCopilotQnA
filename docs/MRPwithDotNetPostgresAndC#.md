Are there any open source MRP apps that use .NET, C# and Postgres?  Do you know of any good tutorials that cover general MRP apps?

Yes, there are open-source MRP (Material Requirements Planning) applications that use .NET, C#, and PostgreSQL. However, finding a specific open-source MRP application that uses all these technologies might be challenging as the choice of technology stack varies widely among open-source projects.

For tutorials on general MRP applications, you might find the following resources helpful:

1. [SAP Business One MRP Wizard Tutorial](^1^): This video tutorial shows how to use the SAP Business One MRP Wizard to manage materials more effectively¹.

2. [Manufacturing in Two or Three Steps | Odoo MRP](^2^): This tutorial shows how to manufacture a product in three steps using Odoo MRP².

3. [MRP Overview | Odoo MRP](^3^): This video provides an overview of MRP and covers the basics of MRP³.

4. [Running Material Requirements Planning - SAP Learning](^8^): This SAP learning journey provides interactive tutorials on Material Requirements Planning⁸.

Please note that while these tutorials might not specifically use .NET, C#, and PostgreSQL, the concepts and principles they cover are generally applicable across different technology stacks. You can adapt these concepts to your chosen technologies. Happy learning!
