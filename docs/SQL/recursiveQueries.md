A recursive query is one that refers to itself or a similar query in order to repeat operations iteratively. This is particularly useful for tasks like traversing hierarchical data structures (e.g., organizational charts, family trees) or performing cumulative calculations.

### Key Characteristics of Recursive Queries
1. **Self-Referencing**:
   - Recursive queries include a `UNION ALL` (or `UNION`) clause that combines a recursive part with a non-recursive part.
   - The recursive part of the query references the CTE itself.

2. **Anchor Member**:
   - The initial part of the CTE, called the anchor member, provides the starting point for the recursion. This is usually a simple `SELECT` statement that retrieves the base rows.

3. **Recursive Member**:
   - The second part, known as the recursive member, repeatedly applies the recursive logic. It references the CTE and includes a condition to limit the recursion.

4. **Termination Condition**:
   - A well-designed recursive query includes a termination condition to prevent infinite loops, usually implemented through a `WHERE` clause.

### Example: Employee Hierarchy
Imagine you have an employee table with columns for employee ID, name, and manager ID. You want to find the hierarchy of employees starting from a particular manager.

#### Table Structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    manager_id INT
);
```

#### Recursive CTE Example:
```sql
WITH EmployeeHierarchy AS (
    -- Anchor Member: Start with employees who have no manager (top of the hierarchy)
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        name,
        manager_id,
        0 AS level
    FROM 
        employees
    WHERE 
        manager_id IS NULL

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive Member: Join employees with their managers to build the hierarchy
    SELECT 
        e.employee_id,
        e.name,
        e.manager_id,
        eh.level + 1
    FROM 
        employees e
    INNER JOIN 
        EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.employee_id
)
-- Final Query: Select the results from the CTE
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    name,
    manager_id,
    level
FROM 
    EmployeeHierarchy
ORDER BY 
    level, employee_id;
```

### Explanation:
- **Anchor Member**: This part selects employees who have no manager, starting the hierarchy at the top level (level 0).
- **Recursive Member**: This part repeatedly joins the employees table with the CTE to find all employees reporting to the current set of managers, incrementing the level each time.
- **Termination Condition**: The recursion stops when there are no more employees to join with.

### Use Cases for Recursive Queries:
- Hierarchical data traversal (e.g., organizational charts, family trees).
- Graph traversal (e.g., finding paths in a network).
- Performing cumulative calculations (e.g., calculating running totals).
