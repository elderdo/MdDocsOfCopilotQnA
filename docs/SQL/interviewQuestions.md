### Question
What are some typical SQL Interview questions and the answers for those questions?

### Answer
Here are some typical SQL interview questions along with their answers:

### **1. What is the difference between `DELETE` and `TRUNCATE`?**
- **Answer**: 
  - `DELETE` removes rows one at a time and logs each deletion, making it slower but allowing you to use conditions (`WHERE` clause). It can be rolled back.
  - `TRUNCATE` removes all rows from a table without logging individual row deletions, making it faster. It cannot be rolled back in many database systems and resets identity columns.

### **2. What is a primary key?**
- **Answer**: 
  - A primary key is a unique identifier for a row in a table. It ensures that each row in the table is unique and cannot contain NULL values. It often serves as a reference point for foreign keys in other tables.

### **3. Explain the difference between `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`.**
- **Answer**: 
  - `INNER JOIN` returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
  - `LEFT JOIN` (or `LEFT OUTER JOIN`) returns all the rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.

### **4. What is an index?**
- **Answer**: 
  - An index is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. It can be created on one or more columns and allows the database engine to locate rows more quickly and efficiently. However, indexes can also slow down `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations because the index must be updated.

### **5. What is normalization?**
- **Answer**: 
  - Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves decomposing a table into smaller tables and defining relationships between them. The goal is to ensure that each piece of data is stored in only one place.

### **6. What is a foreign key?**
- **Answer**: 
  - A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that references the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables and enforces referential integrity, ensuring that the value in the foreign key column matches a valid primary key value in the referenced table.

### **7. Explain the concept of `ACID` properties.**
- **Answer**: 
  - **Atomicity**: Ensures that each transaction is treated as a single unit, which either succeeds completely or fails completely.
  - **Consistency**: Ensures that a transaction takes the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants.
  - **Isolation**: Ensures that the execution of concurrent transactions does not affect the result of each transaction.
  - **Durability**: Ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it remains so, even in the event of a system failure.

### **8. What is a `VIEW`?**
- **Answer**: 
  - A `VIEW` is a virtual table based on the result set of an SQL query. It can include columns from one or more tables and allows users to simplify complex queries, restrict access to data, and present data in a specific format.

### **9. How do you optimize a slow-running query?**
- **Answer**: 
  - **Check indexes**: Ensure proper indexes are in place.
  - **Avoid `SELECT *`**: Select only the columns you need.
  - **Use `EXPLAIN`**: Use the `EXPLAIN` statement to analyze query execution plans.
  - **Optimize joins**: Ensure joins are necessary and efficient.
  - **Avoid subqueries**: Replace subqueries with joins where possible.
  - **Consider denormalization**: In some cases, denormalizing the database may help.

### **10. What is a stored procedure?**
- **Answer**: 
  - A stored procedure is a precompiled set of SQL statements stored in the database that can be executed as a single unit. Stored procedures can improve performance, enhance security, and encapsulate business logic.

### Question 
Can you give some SQL examples for # 3?

### Answer
Certainly! Here are examples illustrating the differences between `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`:

### **INNER JOIN Example**

**Scenario**: You have two tables, `Employees` and `Departments`, and you want to retrieve all employees along with their department names. Only employees who have an assigned department should be included in the result.

**Employees Table**:
| EmployeeID | Name       | DepartmentID |
|------------|------------|--------------|
| 1          | John Smith | 1            |
| 2          | Jane Doe   | 2            |
| 3          | Bob Brown  | NULL         |

**Departments Table**:
| DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
|--------------|----------------|
| 1            | HR             |
| 2            | IT             |
| 3            | Marketing      |

**INNER JOIN Query**:
```sql
SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.Name,
    d.DepartmentName
FROM 
    Employees e
INNER JOIN 
    Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
```

**Result**:
| EmployeeID | Name       | DepartmentName |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| 1          | John Smith | HR             |
| 2          | Jane Doe   | IT             |

### **LEFT JOIN Example**

**Scenario**: You want to retrieve all employees along with their department names. Employees who do not have an assigned department should also be included in the result, with the department name set to `NULL`.

**LEFT JOIN Query**:
```sql
SELECT 
    e.EmployeeID,
    e.Name,
    d.DepartmentName
FROM 
    Employees e
LEFT JOIN 
    Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
```

**Result**:
| EmployeeID | Name       | DepartmentName |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| 1          | John Smith | HR             |
| 2          | Jane Doe   | IT             |
| 3          | Bob Brown  | NULL           |

### **Explanation**:
- **INNER JOIN**:
  - Returns rows that have matching values in both tables (`Employees` and `Departments`).
  - Only employees with a department assignment appear in the result.
  
- **LEFT JOIN**:
  - Returns all rows from the left table (`Employees`), and matched rows from the right table (`Departments`).
  - Employees without a department assignment are also included, with `NULL` for the department name.

These examples highlight how `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` can be used to achieve different results based on whether you want to include unmatched rows or not.
