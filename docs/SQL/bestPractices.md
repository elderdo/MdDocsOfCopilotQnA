Writing efficient and readable SQL queries for SQL Server involves following some best practices. Here are some key tips:

### **1. Use Clear and Consistent Formatting**
- **Uppercase Keywords**: Use uppercase for SQL keywords like `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, etc.
- **Lowercase or Snake Case for Names**: Use lowercase or snake case (with underscores) for table and column names. For example, `customer_orders` or `CustomerOrders`.
- **Consistent Indentation**: Use consistent indentation to make your queries easier to read.

### **2. Avoid Using `SELECT *`**
- **Specify Columns**: Instead of using `SELECT *`, specify the columns you need. This improves performance and readability.

### **3. Use Aliases**
- **Descriptive Aliases**: Use clear and concise aliases for tables and columns. This makes your queries easier to understand.

### **4. Use Joins Explicitly**
- **Explicit Joins**: Use explicit `JOIN` clauses instead of implicit joins. This makes the relationships between tables clearer.

### **5. Comment Your Code**
- **Add Comments**: Include comments to explain complex parts of your queries. This helps others (and yourself) understand the logic behind the query.

### **6. Format Dates Consistently**
- **Consistent Date Formatting**: Use consistent date formats to avoid confusion.

### **7. Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
- **CTEs for Complex Queries**: Use CTEs to simplify complex queries and improve readability.

### **8. Optimize Performance**
- **Indexing**: Ensure that your tables are properly indexed to improve query performance.
- **Avoid Unnecessary Calculations**: Minimize calculations and functions in your `SELECT` statements to improve performance.

### **Example**
Here's an example of a well-structured SQL query:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.name AS customer_name,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date
FROM 
    customers c
INNER JOIN 
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE 
    o.order_date >= '2023-01-01'
ORDER BY 
    o.order_date;
```
