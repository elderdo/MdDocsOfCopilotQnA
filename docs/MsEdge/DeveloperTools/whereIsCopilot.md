### question

I am in MS Edge Settings and automatically signed in with my Outlook account. I cannot find Copilot. Where would it be? Do I have to add a Copilot Extension?

### answer

To access Copilot in Microsoft Edge, follow these steps:

1. **Open Microsoft Edge**:

   - Ensure you are signed in with your Outlook account.

2. **Access the Sidebar**:

   - Look for the **Copilot icon** in the browser sidebar. It should be located on the right side of the browser window.

3. **Enable Copilot**:

   - If you don't see the Copilot icon, you might need to enable it. Go to **Settings** > **Appearance** and ensure the **Show sidebar** option is turned on.

4. **Check for Updates**:
   - Make sure your Microsoft Edge browser is up to date. Sometimes, new features like Copilot are only available in the latest versions.

You do not need to add a separate Copilot extension, as it is integrated into Microsoft Edge¹².
