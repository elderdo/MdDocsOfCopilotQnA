### question

For Outlook 365 is there a way to have it populate the To address with a specific name after typing a Last name and having it automatically pick a favorite email address?

### answer

Certainly! In **Outlook 365**, you can take advantage of the **Contact Suggestions List** to streamline your email addressing process. Here's how:

1. **Start typing** the last name of the contact in the **To**, **Cc**, or **Bcc** field.
2. The **Contact Suggestions List** will display up to five matching names or addresses based on what you've entered.
3. For example, if you type a "b," it will present suggested matches.
4. The list refines as you continue typing, considering first names, last names, email addresses, and other contact information.
5. To add a contact, simply select it from the list.
6. If a name isn't showing up in the suggestions, click the **To**, **Cc**, or **Bcc** button to open the **Add recipients window**.
7. From there, you can search your personal contact list or your organization's **Global Address List (GAL)** to find the specific contact you want to add.
8. Once you've selected the contact, it will automatically populate the address field.

Remember that this feature works best when both you and the recipient have **Microsoft 365** or **Microsoft Exchange** email accounts within the same organization¬π. Happy emailing! üìßüëç
