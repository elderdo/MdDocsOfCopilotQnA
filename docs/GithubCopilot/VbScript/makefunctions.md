### question

How do you ask Github Copilot to create functions of specific vbscript code with VS Code in order to simplify it? After you get the suggestions, how do do close the window opened by github copilot for vs code?

### answer

To ask GitHub Copilot to create functions from specific VBScript code in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. **Open the VBScript file**: Ensure your VBScript file is open in Visual Studio Code.
2. **Highlight the code**: Select the specific code you want to refactor into functions.
3. **Invoke GitHub Copilot**: Use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Enter` (Mac) to bring up GitHub Copilot suggestions.
4. **Provide instructions**: Add comments or instructions within the code to guide Copilot. For example:

```vbscript
' Create a function for this block of code
Dim result
result = a + b
```

5. **Review suggestions**: Copilot will provide suggestions for creating functions. You can cycle through these suggestions using the `Tab` key.
6. **Accept a suggestion**: Once you find a suitable suggestion, press `Enter` to accept it.

To close the GitHub Copilot suggestions window, you can:

- **Press `Esc`**: This will close the suggestions window.
- **Click outside the window**: Clicking anywhere outside the suggestions window will also close it.

Feel free to ask if you have any more questions!
