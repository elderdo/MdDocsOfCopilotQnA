### question

How do you tell GitHub Copilot to refactor specific code of a vbscript file from vs code?

### answer

To refactor specific code in a VBScript file using GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. **Open the VBScript file**: Ensure your VBScript file is open in Visual Studio Code.
2. **Highlight the code**: Select the specific code you want to refactor.
3. **Invoke GitHub Copilot**: Use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Enter` (Mac) to bring up GitHub Copilot suggestions.
4. **Review suggestions**: Copilot will provide refactoring suggestions. You can cycle through these suggestions using the `Tab` key.
5. **Accept a suggestion**: Once you find a suitable refactoring suggestion, press `Enter` to accept it.

You can also provide comments or instructions within the code to guide Copilot on how you want the refactoring to be done. For example:

```vbscript
' Refactor this function to improve readability
Function CalculateSum(a, b)
    CalculateSum = a + b
End Function
```

This will help Copilot understand your intent and provide more accurate suggestions.
