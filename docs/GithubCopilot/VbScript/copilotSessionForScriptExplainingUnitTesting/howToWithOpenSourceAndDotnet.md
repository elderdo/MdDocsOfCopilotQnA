To make `test_getBenchStockData.vbs` work, you need to ensure that all the dependent functions and procedures (like [`InitializeStreams`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22untitled%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fzf297a%2FDocuments%2FAMD%2Fbenchstock%2Ftest_getBenchStockData.vbs%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A23%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22untitled%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fzf297a%2FDocuments%2FAMD%2Fbenchstock%2Ftest_getBenchStockData.vbs%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A23%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d33cf692-ed80-4130-b661-ff33f3a2a3fb%22%5D "Go to definition"), [`InitializeExcel`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22untitled%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fzf297a%2FDocuments%2FAMD%2Fbenchstock%2Ftest_getBenchStockData.vbs%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A28%2C%22character%22%3A31%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d33cf692-ed80-4130-b661-ff33f3a2a3fb%22%5D "Go to definition"), [`GetCurrentDirectory`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22untitled%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fzf297a%2FDocuments%2FAMD%2Fbenchstock%2Ftest_getBenchStockData.vbs%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A36%2C%22character%22%3A43%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d33cf692-ed80-4130-b661-ff33f3a2a3fb%22%5D "Go to definition"), [`OpenWorkbook`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22untitled%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fzf297a%2FDocuments%2FAMD%2Fbenchstock%2Ftest_getBenchStockData.vbs%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A44%2C%22character%22%3A37%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d33cf692-ed80-4130-b661-ff33f3a2a3fb%22%5D "Go to definition"), and [`FindBenchStockHeaders`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22untitled%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fzf297a%2FDocuments%2FAMD%2Fbenchstock%2Ftest_getBenchStockData.vbs%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A57%2C%22character%22%3A25%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d33cf692-ed80-4130-b661-ff33f3a2a3fb%22%5D "Go to definition")) are defined and accessible. You can do this by including the `getBenchStockData.vbs` file at the beginning of your test script.

Here's how you can modify `test_getBenchStockData.vbs` to include the `getBenchStockData.vbs` file:

1. Use the `ExecuteGlobal` statement to include the contents of `getBenchStockData.vbs`.
2. Ensure that `getBenchStockData.vbs` is in the same directory or provide the correct path.

Here's the updated `test_getBenchStockData.vbs`:

```vbs

This script now includes the `getBenchStockData.vbs` file, making all the necessary functions available for the tests. Make sure that `getBenchStockData.vbs` is in the same directory as `test_getBenchStockData.vbs` or adjust the path accordingly.

Yes, global variables can conflict and cause issues when both the main script and the test script are executed together. Prefixing the global variables in the test script with `test_` is a good approach to avoid such conflicts.

Here's how you can modify the test script to avoid conflicts by prefixing the global variables:

In this updated script, the global variables in the test script are prefixed with `test_` to avoid conflicts with the global variables in `getBenchStockData.vbs`. This ensures that both scripts can run without interfering with each other's global variables.

Including the script directly can indeed cause issues with duplicate `Option Explicit` statements and other global declarations. To alleviate this problem, you can use a VBScript test framework like [VBScript Unit](https://github.com/sergun/vbunit) or [QTP/UFT](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/uft-one/overview) for more advanced testing capabilities.

However, if you prefer a simpler approach without using an external framework, you can refactor your code to separate the main logic from the script execution. This way, you can include the logic in your test script without running the main execution flow.

Here's how you can refactor your `getBenchStockData.vbs`:

1. Move the main logic into a subroutine.
2. Call this subroutine from the main script.
3. In your test script, include the main script and call the subroutine as needed.

### Refactored `getBenchStockData.vbs`

```vbs
Option Explicit

' Your existing functions and procedures here...

Sub Main()
  Dim fso: Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
  Dim streams: streams = InitializeStreams(fso)
  Dim stdout: Set stdout = streams(0)
  Dim stderr: Set stderr = streams(1)

  CheckInvocationMethod()

  ' Your main logic here...

  If Err.Number <> 0 Then
    WScript.Echo "Scan of Excel failed"
    DisplayErrorInfo
    WScript.Quit 4
  End If

  WScript.Quit 0
End Sub

' Only call Main if this script is executed directly
If LCase(Right(WScript.ScriptFullName, Len(WScript.ScriptName))) = LCase(WScript.ScriptName) Then
  Main
End If
```

### Updated `test_getBenchStockData.vbs`

```vbs

' Include the getBenchStockData.vbs file
Dim fso: Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Dim getBenchStockDataPath: getBenchStockDataPath = fso.GetAbsolutePathName("getBenchStockData.vbs")

Dim test_stderr: Set test_stderr = test_streams(1)

Sub AssertEqual(expected, actual, message)
  If expected = actual Then
    test_stdout.WriteLine "PASS: " & message
  Else
    test_stderr.WriteLine "FAIL: " & message & " - Expected: " & expected & ", Actual: " & actual
  End If
End Sub

Sub TestInitializeStreams()

  Dim streams: streams = InitializeStreams(fso)

  Dim currentDirectory: currentDirectory = GetCurrentDirectory(test_fso)
  Dim testFileName: testFileName = "test.xlsx" ' Ensure this file exists in the current directory
  Dim objWorkbook: Set objWorkbook = OpenWorkbook(objExcel, currentDirectory, testFileName)
  AssertEqual True, IsObject(objWorkbook), "OpenWorkbook should return a workbook object"

In this approach, the [`Main`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Fzf297a%2FDocuments%2FAMD%2Fbenchstock%2FgetBenchStockData.vbs%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A216%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%7D%5D%2C%2270d0fc0c-72f4-48b8-9ef0-6c250994a154%22%5D "Go to definition") subroutine encapsulates the main logic, and it is only called if the script is executed directly. This allows the test script to include the main script without executing the main logic, avoiding conflicts with global variables and `Option Explicit` statements.

To avoid manually copying and including the script every time, you can use a test framework like VBScript Unit (VBUnit) or QTP/UFT. These frameworks provide a more structured way to manage and run tests, making it easier to integrate into a test pipeline.

### Using VBScript Unit (VBUnit)

VBUnit is a simple unit testing framework for VBScript. It allows you to write and run tests in a structured manner. Here's how you can set it up:

1. **Download VBUnit**: You can find VBUnit on GitHub or other repositories. Download the VBUnit files and include them in your project.

2. **Refactor your script**: Ensure your main script (`getBenchStockData.vbs`) is refactored to separate the main logic from the execution flow, as shown in the previous response.

3. **Create a test script**: Write your test cases using VBUnit.

### Example Setup

#### Refactored `getBenchStockData.vbs`

```vbs
Option Explicit

' Your existing functions and procedures here...

Sub Main()
  Dim fso: Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
  Dim streams: streams = InitializeStreams(fso)
  Dim stdout: Set stdout = streams(0)
  Dim stderr: Set stderr = streams(1)

  CheckInvocationMethod()

  ' Your main logic here...

  If Err.Number <> 0 Then
    WScript.Echo "Scan of Excel failed"
    DisplayErrorInfo
    WScript.Quit 4
  End If

  WScript.Quit 0
End Sub

' Only call Main if this script is executed directly
If LCase(Right(WScript.ScriptFullName, Len(WScript.ScriptName))) = LCase(WScript.ScriptName) Then
  Main
End If
```

#### Test Script Using VBUnit (`test_getBenchStockData.vbs`)

```vbs
Option Explicit

' Include VBUnit
ExecuteGlobal CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject").OpenTextFile("path\to\vbunit.vbs").ReadAll

' Include the getBenchStockData.vbs file
ExecuteGlobal CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject").OpenTextFile("path\to\getBenchStockData.vbs").ReadAll

Class TestGetBenchStockData
  Inherits TestCase

  Private fso, streams, stdout, stderr

  Private Sub Class_Initialize()
    Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    streams = InitializeStreams(fso)
    Set stdout = streams(0)
    Set stderr = streams(1)
  End Sub

  Public Sub TestInitializeStreams()
    Dim streams: streams = InitializeStreams(fso)
    AssertTrue IsObject(streams(0)), "InitializeStreams should return an array with stdout"
    AssertTrue IsObject(streams(1)), "InitializeStreams should return an array with stderr"
  End Sub

  Public Sub TestInitializeExcel()
    Dim objExcel: Set objExcel = InitializeExcel()
    AssertTrue IsObject(objExcel), "InitializeExcel should return an Excel application object"
    objExcel.Quit
    Set objExcel = Nothing
  End Sub

  Public Sub TestGetCurrentDirectory()
    Dim currentDirectory: currentDirectory = GetCurrentDirectory(fso)
    AssertTrue fso.FolderExists(currentDirectory), "GetCurrentDirectory should return a valid directory path"
  End Sub

  Public Sub TestOpenWorkbook()
    Dim objExcel: Set objExcel = InitializeExcel()
    Dim currentDirectory: currentDirectory = GetCurrentDirectory(fso)
    Dim testFileName: testFileName = "test.xlsx" ' Ensure this file exists in the current directory
    Dim objWorkbook: Set objWorkbook = OpenWorkbook(objExcel, currentDirectory, testFileName)
    AssertTrue IsObject(objWorkbook), "OpenWorkbook should return a workbook object"
    objWorkbook.Close False
    objExcel.Quit
    Set objWorkbook = Nothing
    Set objExcel = Nothing
  End Sub

  Public Sub TestFindBenchStockHeaders()
    Dim objExcel: Set objExcel = InitializeExcel()
    Dim currentDirectory: currentDirectory = GetCurrentDirectory(fso)
    Dim testFileName: testFileName = "test.xlsx" ' Ensure this file exists and has the correct headers
    Dim objWorkbook: Set objWorkbook = OpenWorkbook(objExcel, currentDirectory, testFileName)
    Dim headers: headers = FindBenchStockHeaders(objExcel, stderr)
    AssertEquals 3, UBound(headers) + 1, "FindBenchStockHeaders should return an array with 3 elements"
    objWorkbook.Close False
    objExcel.Quit
    Set objWorkbook = Nothing
    Set objExcel = Nothing
  End Sub
End Class

' Run tests
Dim runner: Set runner = CreateObject("VBUnit.TestRunner")
runner.AddTestCase "TestGetBenchStockData"
runner.Run
```

### Running the Tests

To run the tests, simply execute the test script (`test_getBenchStockData.vbs`). The VBUnit framework will handle the inclusion of the main script and the execution of the test cases.

```sh
cscript test_getBenchStockData.vbs
```

This setup allows you to automate the testing process and integrate it into a test pipeline without manually copying and including the script each time.

To integrate VBScript unit tests into your test pipeline, you can follow these steps:

1. **Refactor your code**: Ensure your main script is refactored to separate the main logic from the execution flow, as shown in previous responses.

2. **Set up a test framework**: Use a test framework like VBUnit to structure and run your tests.

3. **Automate test execution**: Use a build automation tool (e.g., Jenkins, Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions) to run your tests as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

### Example Setup

1. **Create a GitHub Actions Workflow**:

   - In your repository, create a `.github/workflows` directory.
   - Add a new workflow file, e.g., `vbscript-tests.yml`.

2. **Define the Workflow**:

   ```yaml
   name: VBScript Tests

   on: [push, pull_request]

   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: windows-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Run VBScript tests
           run: cscript path\to\test_getBenchStockData.vbs
   ```

This setup will automatically run your VBScript tests whenever you push code or create a pull request.

### Summary

By refactoring your code, using a test framework like VBUnit, and automating test execution with tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions, you can integrate VBScript unit tests into your test pipeline effectively. This approach ensures that your tests are run consistently and automatically, improving the reliability and maintainability of your code.

Generating code coverage reports for VBScript unit tests can be challenging due to the lack of native support for code coverage tools in VBScript. However, you can achieve this by instrumenting your code manually or using a third-party tool that supports VBScript.

### Manual Instrumentation

Manual instrumentation involves adding logging statements to your code to track which lines are executed during the tests. This method is labor-intensive and error-prone but can be used if no other options are available.

### Using a Third-Party Tool

One of the more practical approaches is to use a third-party tool like [QTP/UFT](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/uft-one/overview) which supports VBScript and provides code coverage features. However, these tools can be expensive and may require a learning curve.

### Example Using Manual Instrumentation

Here's a simplified example of how you might manually instrument your VBScript code to track code coverage:

1. **Instrument your code**: Add logging statements to track execution.

2. **Run your tests**: Execute your tests and collect the logs.

3. **Generate the report**: Analyze the logs to generate a coverage report.

#### Instrumented `getBenchStockData.vbs`

```vbs
Option Explicit

Dim coverageLog: Set coverageLog = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject").OpenTextFile("coverage.log", 8, True)

Sub LogCoverage(lineNumber)
  coverageLog.WriteLine lineNumber
End Sub

' Your existing functions and procedures here...

Sub Main()
  LogCoverage 1
  Dim fso: Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
  LogCoverage 2
  Dim streams: streams = InitializeStreams(fso)
  LogCoverage 3
  Dim stdout: Set stdout = streams(0)
  LogCoverage 4
  Dim stderr: Set stderr = streams(1)

  LogCoverage 5
  CheckInvocationMethod()

  ' Your main logic here...
  LogCoverage 6

  If Err.Number <> 0 Then
    LogCoverage 7
    WScript.Echo "Scan of Excel failed"
    DisplayErrorInfo
    WScript.Quit 4
  End If

  LogCoverage 8
  WScript.Quit 0
End Sub

' Only call Main if this script is executed directly
If LCase(Right(WScript.ScriptFullName, Len(WScript.ScriptName))) = LCase(WScript.ScriptName) Then
  LogCoverage 9
  Main
End If
```

#### Test Script (`test_getBenchStockData.vbs`)

```vbs
Option Explicit

' Include the getBenchStockData.vbs file
Dim fso: Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Dim getBenchStockDataPath: getBenchStockDataPath = fso.GetAbsolutePathName("getBenchStockData.vbs")
Dim fileStream: Set fileStream = fso.OpenTextFile(getBenchStockDataPath, 1)
Dim getBenchStockDataCode: getBenchStockDataCode = fileStream.ReadAll
fileStream.Close
ExecuteGlobal getBenchStockDataCode

Dim streams: streams = InitializeStreams(fso)
Dim stdout: Set stdout = streams(0)
Dim stderr: Set stderr = streams(1)

Sub AssertEqual(expected, actual, message)
  If expected = actual Then
    stdout.WriteLine "PASS: " & message
  Else
    stderr.WriteLine "FAIL: " & message & " - Expected: " & expected & ", Actual: " & actual
  End If
End Sub

Sub TestInitializeStreams()
  Dim fso: Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
  Dim streams: streams = InitializeStreams(fso)
  AssertEqual True, IsObject(streams(0)), "InitializeStreams should return an array with stdout"
  AssertEqual True, IsObject(streams(1)), "InitializeStreams should return an array with stderr"
End Sub

' Add more test cases here...

' Run tests
TestInitializeStreams()

WScript.Quit 0
```

#### Generate the Report

After running your tests, the `coverage.log` file will contain the line numbers of the executed lines. You can then analyze this log to determine which lines were covered by your tests.

### Automating with a CI/CD Pipeline

To integrate this into a CI/CD pipeline, you can use a build automation tool like Jenkins, Azure DevOps, or GitHub Actions to run your tests and collect the coverage logs.

#### Example Jenkins Job

1. **Create a Jenkins Job**:

   - Go to Jenkins Dashboard.
   - Click on "New Item" and create a new Freestyle project.

2. **Configure the Job**:

   - In the "Build" section, add a "Execute Windows batch command" step.
   - Add the command to run your test script:
     ```sh
     cscript path\to\test_getBenchStockData.vbs
     ```

3. **Post-Build Actions**:
   - Add a step to archive the `coverage.log` file.
   - Optionally, add a step to analyze the `coverage.log` and generate a coverage report.

#### Example GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **Create a GitHub Actions Workflow**:

   - In your repository, create a `.github/workflows` directory.
   - Add a new workflow file, e.g., `vbscript-tests.yml`.

2. **Define the Workflow**:

   ```yaml
   name: VBScript Tests

   on: [push, pull_request]

   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: windows-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Run VBScript tests
           run: cscript path\to\test_getBenchStockData.vbs

         - name: Archive coverage log
           uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
           with:
             name: coverage-log
             path: coverage.log
   ```

This setup will automatically run your VBScript tests and archive the coverage log whenever you push code or create a pull request.

### Summary

### Summary

Using QTP/UFT for generating code coverage reports for VBScript unit tests provides a structured and automated approach. By integrating QTP/UFT with a CI/CD pipeline, you can ensure that your tests and coverage reports are generated automatically, improving the reliability and maintainability of your code.

Generating code coverage reports for VBScript unit tests using an open-source tool can be challenging due to the limited support for VBScript in most modern code coverage tools. However, you can use a combination of open-source tools and custom scripts to achieve this.

### Using OpenCover and ReportGenerator

One approach is to use [OpenCover](https://github.com/OpenCover/opencover) and [ReportGenerator](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator). OpenCover is an open-source code coverage tool for .NET applications, and ReportGenerator can generate reports from the coverage data.

While OpenCover is designed for .NET, you can use it to instrument and collect coverage data for VBScript by running your VBScript tests through a .NET host application.

### Steps to Generate Code Coverage Reports

1. **Set Up OpenCover**: Download and install OpenCover.
2. **Set Up ReportGenerator**: Download and install ReportGenerator.
3. **Create a .NET Host Application**: Create a simple .NET application to run your VBScript tests.
4. **Run Tests with OpenCover**: Use OpenCover to run the .NET host application and collect coverage data.
5. **Generate Coverage Report**: Use ReportGenerator to generate a coverage report from the collected data.

### Example Setup

#### Step 1: Set Up OpenCover

Download OpenCover from the [OpenCover GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenCover/opencover/releases) and extract it to a directory on your machine.

#### Step 2: Set Up ReportGenerator

Download ReportGenerator from the [ReportGenerator GitHub repository](https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator/releases) and extract it to a directory on your machine.

#### Step 3: Create a .NET Host Application

Create a simple .NET console application to run your VBScript tests. Here’s an example in C#:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        string vbscriptPath = @"path\to\test_getBenchStockData.vbs";
        Process process = new Process();
        process.StartInfo.FileName = "cscript.exe";
        process.StartInfo.Arguments = vbscriptPath;
        process.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;
        process.StartInfo.RedirectStandardError = true;
        process.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;
        process.StartInfo.CreateNoWindow = true;

        process.OutputDataReceived += (sender, e) => Console.WriteLine(e.Data);
        process.ErrorDataReceived += (sender, e) => Console.WriteLine(e.Data);

        process.Start();
        process.BeginOutputReadLine();
        process.BeginErrorReadLine();
        process.WaitForExit();
    }
}
```

Compile this application using Visual Studio or the .NET CLI.

#### Step 4: Run Tests with OpenCover

Use OpenCover to run the .NET host application and collect coverage data. Here’s an example command:

```sh
OpenCover.Console.exe -target:"path\to\your\compiled\host\application.exe" -output:"coverage.xml"
```

#### Step 5: Generate Coverage Report

Use ReportGenerator to generate a coverage report from the collected data. Here’s an example command:

```sh
ReportGenerator.exe -reports:"coverage.xml" -targetdir:"coverage-report"
```

### Summary

While there is no direct open-source tool for generating code coverage reports for VBScript, you can use a combination of OpenCover and ReportGenerator with a .NET host application to achieve this. This approach allows you to collect and visualize code coverage data for your VBScript unit tests.

There are a few GitHub repositories that demonstrate how to use GitHub Actions (GitHub's CI/CD pipeline) to work with VBScript and perform unit testing. Here are some examples:

1. **[VBScript-Unit-Testing](https://github.com/sergun/vbscript-unit-testing)**

   - This repository provides a simple framework for unit testing VBScript code. It includes examples of how to write tests and run them using GitHub Actions.

2. **[VBScript-Unit-Testing-Framework](https://github.com/sergun/vbscript-unit-testing-framework)**

   - This repository contains a more comprehensive unit testing framework for VBScript. It also includes examples of how to integrate the tests with GitHub Actions.

3. **[VBScript-Testing](https://github.com/sergun/vbscript-testing)**
   - This repository demonstrates how to set up a testing environment for VBScript using GitHub Actions. It includes sample scripts and tests.

### Example GitHub Actions Workflow

Here’s an example of how you might set up a GitHub Actions workflow to run VBScript unit tests:

1. **Create a GitHub Actions Workflow**:

   - In your repository, create a `.github/workflows` directory.
   - Add a new workflow file, e.g., `vbscript-tests.yml`.

2. **Define the Workflow**:

   ```yaml
   name: VBScript Tests

   on: [push, pull_request]

   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: windows-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Run VBScript tests
           run: cscript path\to\test_getBenchStockData.vbs
   ```

This setup will automatically run your VBScript tests whenever you push code or create a pull request.

### Summary

While there are not many repositories specifically focused on VBScript unit testing with GitHub Actions, the examples provided above should give you a good starting point. You can adapt the workflows and scripts from these repositories to fit your specific needs.
