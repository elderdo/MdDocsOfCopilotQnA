What is the benefit of the nUnit's annotation [TestFixture]?

The `[TestFixture]` annotation in NUnit provides several benefits:

- **Class Identification**: It marks a class that contains tests, making it clear which classes are intended for testing.
- **Setup and Teardown**: It allows the use of `[SetUp]` and `[TearDown]` annotations for methods that run before and after each test, respectively, ensuring a clean test environment.
- **Parameterized Tests**: It supports parameterized test fixtures, enabling the same set of tests to run with different data.
- **Test Organization**: It helps in organizing tests within a class, making the test suite more maintainable and readable.

These features enhance the structure and functionality of your test suite, making it easier to manage and execute tests.
