### Since Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http has been deprecated what package should replace it?

The `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http` package has indeed been deprecated. To replace it, you should add a `FrameworkReference` to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` in your `.csproj` file¹. Here's how you can do it:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
    <!--... rest of file-->
    <ItemGroup>
        <FrameworkReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App" />
    </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

This change allows you to use ASP.NET Core parts in a class library project¹. Please note that this approach might not work for Blazor WebAssembly, and you may need to split up libraries for WASM/Server².

### You answer uses a deprecated package Microsoft.AspNetCore.App. What is the correct package to use?

I apologize for the confusion. The `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` package has also been deprecated¹. For .NET 7 and onwards, you no longer need to reference these packages explicitly in your `.csproj` file². The required libraries are included in the SDK and runtime installers².

If you're updating an existing web app, it's recommended to create a new project with `dotnet new mvc` (or another template that aligns with your needs), and then compare your existing `.csproj` with the new project's `.csproj`¹. This way, you can see what `PackageReferences` it has by default, and delete other packages from your `.csproj`, unless your app uses them¹.

For a class library that references ASP.NET Core APIs, you can follow the [official documentation](^5^) for guidance¹.

Please note that the exact solution may vary depending on the specifics of your project and its dependencies. If you encounter any issues, please provide more details about your project setup.

### After removing deprecated package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http I get an error for the IFormFile interface that is namespace is missing. What package has that interface that is not deprecated?

The `IFormFile` interface is part of the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features.dll` assembly¹. This assembly is included in the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.Features` package¹.

However, if you're using .NET 7 or later, `IFormFile` has been integrated automatically by default². Thus, you don't need to install or include any additional NuGet package for that². If you're using `IFormFile` within a class library within .NET 7, you can use the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http` NuGet package².

Please ensure that your project file (.csproj) includes a reference to the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` framework². Here's an example of how to do this:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <FrameworkReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App" />
</ItemGroup>
```

This tells the project that the whole "AspNetCore" thing is now part of the shared .NET framework and can be used safely, without requiring any additional dependency at compile- or run-time².

### The V2 feed at 'https://sres.web.boeing.com/artifactory/api/nuget/v3/Nuget-Boeing-Releases/Search()?$filter=IsAbsoluteLatestVersion&searchTerm=''&targetFramework='net8.0'&includePrerelease=true&$skip=0&$top=26&semVerLevel=2.0.0' returned an unexpected status code '403 Forbidden'.

The `403 Forbidden` error typically indicates that the server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it. This status is often returned if the request lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource¹. Here are some potential causes for this error in your context:

1. **Authentication Issues**: If you recently changed your system password, you might need to update your credentials in the Credential Manager¹.

2. **Proxy Issues**: If you're in a corporate environment, there might be a proxy that NuGet isn't authenticating with properly¹.

3. **Permission Issues**: The build service might not have permission to access your Azure Artifacts feed³.

4. **Cache Issues**: Sometimes clearing NuGet caches can solve the issue. In Visual Studio, go to Tools > Options > NuGet Package Manager > Click on Clear All NuGet Caches¹.

Please check these potential issues. If the problem persists, more details about your setup would be helpful to provide a more precise solution.
