### What is the most popular and widely used Fortran 2003 Open Source project, utilities or frameworks ?

Based on the number of stars on GitHub, which is a common measure of popularity for open-source projects, the most popular Fortran 2003 open-source project is **OpenBLAS**⁵. It's a highly optimized library for linear algebra operations, widely used in scientific computing.

For utilities, the **Fortran Standard Library (stdlib)**⁵ and **coretran**² are popular choices. They provide a set of standard routines and object-oriented classes for Fortran, including sorting, handling scientific data, and more.

In terms of frameworks, **DISLIN**² and **gtk-fortran**⁵ are popular for creating GUIs in Fortran. For advanced mathematics, libraries like **BLAS**² and **LAPACK**⁵ are widely used.

Please note that the popularity of a project doesn't necessarily mean it's the best fit for your needs. It's always a good idea to explore multiple options and choose the one that best suits your specific requirements. Also, the popularity of projects can change over time as new projects emerge and existing ones evolve.
