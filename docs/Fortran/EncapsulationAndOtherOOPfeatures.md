### For fortran 2003 can you show examples of encapsulation? I noticed private and public keywords can it also have static variables and classes? Can functions or subroutines or methods be described as private, public or static? If so, can you show some examples of each kind? Also, what qualifies as a method and can they return classes or native types? Do string data types exist and are there any mehtods associated with them? Are there any ways to create libraries and import or use them like Java or C#? Does the null type exist? Finally, can Fortran data persist or be stored in a database of any type?

Fortran 2003 introduced several features that support object-oriented programming, including encapsulation¹². Here's a brief overview of your queries:

**Encapsulation**: Fortran 2003 supports encapsulation through the use of modules and derived types². You can define data and procedures within a module and control their accessibility using the `public` and `private` attributes².

**Static Variables and Classes**: Fortran doesn't have the concept of static variables or classes like in C++ or Java. However, it does have the `save` attribute which can be used to preserve the value of a local variable across subroutine calls[^10^]¹¹.

**Private, Public, Static Functions/Subroutines/Methods**: In Fortran, you can define functions and subroutines as `public` or `private` within a module². There's no concept of `static` functions or methods in Fortran. A method in Fortran is a procedure that is bound to a derived type²⁶.

**Methods Return Types**: Methods in Fortran can return any data type, including derived types².

**String Data Types and Methods**: Fortran does support string data types. However, it doesn't have built-in string methods like in some other languages.

**Libraries**: Fortran allows you to create libraries of subprograms using commands like `ar`[^20^]. You can then link these libraries while building your program¹⁹.

**Null Type**: Fortran doesn't have a `null` type per se. However, it does have a `null()` function that returns a disassociated pointer²².

**Data Persistence and Database Storage**: Fortran doesn't have built-in support for databases. However, you can interface Fortran with databases using different interfaces such as ODBC, JDBC, database-specific APIs, and communication/middleware software²⁶.

Here's an example of encapsulation in Fortran 2003:

```fortran
module my_module
  implicit none
  private
  integer, public :: public_var
  integer :: private_var
contains
  subroutine public_subroutine()
    ! This subroutine can be accessed outside the module.
  end subroutine public_subroutine

  subroutine private_subroutine()
    ! This subroutine cannot be accessed outside the module.
  end subroutine private_subroutine
end module my_module
```

In this example, `public_var` and `public_subroutine()` can be accessed outside the module, while `private_var` and `private_subroutine()` cannot. This is a simple form of encapsulation in Fortran 2003. Note that this is a basic example and actual usage may involve more complex data structures and procedures.

Please note that this is a high-level overview and the actual implementation can vary based on specific requirements and the features supported by your Fortran compiler. For detailed information, you should refer to the Fortran 2003 standard or a comprehensive Fortran 2003 guide¹.
