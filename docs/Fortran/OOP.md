### Can you list all the OOP features for fortran 2003?

Sure, here are the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features introduced in Fortran 2003:

1. **Class**: Fortran 2003 introduced the concept of classes. A class is a unit of definition of data and behavior, which forms the basis of modularity and structure in an object-oriented program¹.

2. **Object**: An object is an instance of a class. Each object has its own separate data, which characterize the state of the object¹.

3. **Encapsulation**: This is the protection of the internal structure of objects against manipulation, unless via the objects' exposed interface¹.

4. **Message Passing (Interfacing)**: This is the process by which an object sends data to another object or asks the other object to invoke a method¹.

5. **Inheritance**: This is a mechanism for creating subclasses by specializing or extending another class. All data and functions of the superclass(es) are acquired, but data/methods may be added/changed¹.

6. **Abstraction**: This is the ability of a program to ignore the details of an object's subclass and work at a more generic level when appropriate¹.

7. **Derived Type Enhancements**: Fortran 2003 introduced enhancements to derived types³.

8. **Type-bound Procedures**: These are procedures that are bound to a type definition².

9. **Type Finalization**: This is a feature that allows for clean-up operations when an object goes out of scope³.

10. **Abstract and Generic Interfaces**: These are interfaces that allow for more flexible procedure definitions³.

11. **Polymorphism**: This is the ability for a variable to refer to objects of different types³.

12. **PASS attribute**: This attribute specifies the dummy argument in a type-bound procedure that corresponds to the passed-object dummy argument³.

Please note that while Fortran 2003 introduced many OOP features, it does not support all features found in some other OOP languages, such as reflection or Inversion of Control (IoC).
