### question

What are the new features of Fortran 2003?

### answer

Fortran 2003 introduced several significant features and enhancements:

1. **Object-Oriented Programming**:

   - **Type Extension and Inheritance**: Allows for creating derived types that extend existing ones³.
   - **Polymorphism**: Supports dynamic type allocation and type-bound procedures³.
   - **Procedure Pointers**: Enables pointers to procedures, enhancing flexibility³.

2. **Interoperability with C**: Standardized methods for interfacing with C, making it easier to integrate Fortran code with C libraries³.

3. **Derived Type Enhancements**:

   - **Parameterized Derived Types**: Allows for more flexible data structures³.
   - **Finalization**: Provides mechanisms for cleaning up resources when derived types go out of scope³.

4. **Data Manipulation Enhancements**:

   - **Allocatable Components and Dummy Arguments**: Improves memory management and performance⁵.
   - **VOLATILE and ASYNCHRONOUS Attributes**: Facilitates interaction with non-Fortran processes and asynchronous I/O².

5. **Input/Output Enhancements**:

   - **Stream I/O**: Supports reading and writing data streams².
   - **Enhanced File Handling**: Improved methods for file operations².

6. **IEEE 754 Support**: Enhanced support for IEEE floating-point arithmetic, ensuring better numerical precision and robustness².

These features collectively modernized Fortran, making it more versatile and capable of handling contemporary programming challenges¹²³⁵.
