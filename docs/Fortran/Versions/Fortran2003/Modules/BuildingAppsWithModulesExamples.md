### For a Fortran 2003 are there any github repositories that contain modules and build scripts utilizing the folder structure suggested for such projects?

Yes, there are several GitHub repositories that contain Fortran 2003 modules and build scripts. Here are a few examples:

1. [forpy](^1^): This repository allows you to use Python from Fortran¹.
2. [ogpf](^1^): This is an object-based interface to GnuPlot from Fortran 2003, 2008 and later¹.
3. [fortrangis](^1^): This repository contains a collection of Fortran interfaces to the most common Open Source GIS libraries¹.
4. [forbear](^1^): This repository provides a Fortran (progress) B (e)ar environment¹.
5. [focal](^1^): This is a modern Fortran abstraction layer for OpenCL¹.
6. [petaca](^1^): This repository contains a collection of foundational Fortran modules¹.

Each of these repositories has its own build scripts and folder structure. You can explore these repositories to understand how they organize their modules and build scripts. Please note that the exact organization can vary depending on the specific requirements of each project.
