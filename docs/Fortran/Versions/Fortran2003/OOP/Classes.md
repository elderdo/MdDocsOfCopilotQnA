### Does Fortran 2003 have anything similar to a class or an interface like other OOP languages?

Yes, Fortran 2003 does support Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts similar to classes and interfaces found in other OOP languages².

1. **Classes**: In Fortran 2003, you can create classes using the `TYPE` keyword¹. These are known as derived types. You can also use the `CLASS` keyword to refer to these types or any of their extended types¹. This is similar to how classes work in other OOP languages.

```fortran
MODULE myModule
    IMPLICIT NONE
    TYPE :: myClass
        INTEGER :: myVar
    END TYPE myClass
END MODULE myModule

PROGRAM main
    USE myModule
    TYPE(myClass) :: obj
    obj%myVar = 10
    PRINT *, obj%myVar
END PROGRAM main
```

2. **Interfaces**: Fortran 2003 supports interfaces through type-bound procedures². These allow you to bind procedures (methods) to a type (class), providing functionality similar to interfaces in other OOP languages.

```fortran
MODULE myModule
    IMPLICIT NONE
    TYPE :: myClass
        INTEGER :: myVar
    CONTAINS
        PROCEDURE :: setVar
    END TYPE myClass

    CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE setVar(this, val)
        CLASS(myClass), INTENT(INOUT) :: this
        INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: val
        this%myVar = val
    END SUBROUTINE setVar
END MODULE myModule

PROGRAM main
    USE myModule
    TYPE(myClass) :: obj
    CALL obj%setVar(20)
    PRINT *, obj%myVar
END PROGRAM main
```

In this example, `setVar` is a method bound to the `myClass` type. It can be invoked on an object of `myClass` type, similar to how methods are invoked on objects in other OOP languages².
