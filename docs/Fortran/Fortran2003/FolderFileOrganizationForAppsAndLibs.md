### For a Fortran 2003 application what is a good project structure for utilizing libraries like FLogger, XFunit, or package user defined subroutines? For GNU Fortran 8.3.0 what compile and link options are required to utilize libraries and perform an application build? Are there any tools that help do this like maven or pip for library management? Should modern applicatioins be developed utilizing these new features like other modern languages?

**Fortran 2003 Application Project Structure**
A good project structure for a Fortran 2003 application utilizing libraries like FLogger, XFunit, or user-defined subroutines would be modular⁹[^10^]. Here's a suggested structure:

- `src/`: Contains all source files for the library⁷.
- `include/`: Holds all compiled `*.mod` files⁷.
- `lib/`: Where static libraries are created⁷.
- `applications/`: Houses the application code that uses these libraries⁷.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests using XFunit or similar.

Each module should be in its own source file, and the module name should match the filepath for easy navigation⁹.

**GNU Fortran 8.3.0 Compile and Link Options**
To compile and link libraries in GNU Fortran 8.3.0, you can use the `-c` option to compile the source files into object files, and then use `ar` to create the library⁸. For example:

```bash
gfortran -c file1.f90 file2.f90
ar r supportlib.a file1.o file2.o
```

To link the library to your application, you can use the `-L` option to specify the library path and `-l` to specify the library name¹¹. For example:

```bash
gfortran -o application application.f90 -L. -lsupportlib
```

**Library Management Tools for Fortran**
While Fortran does not have a direct equivalent to Maven or Pip, the Fortran Package Manager (fpm) is a similar tool that can help manage libraries¹². It allows for quickly locating fpm packages and generating the associated dependency lines to insert into fpm package manifest files.

**Utilizing New Features in Modern Fortran Applications**
Yes, modern Fortran applications should utilize new features introduced in the latest versions of the language. The latest versions, like Fortran 2008 and 2018, have introduced modern programming concepts like object-oriented programming and coarray features for parallel computing⁴. These features allow for writing clean, modular, and easy-to-maintain code, while keeping the performance benefits Fortran is renowned for⁴. However, the decision to use these features should be based on the specific needs and constraints of your project.
