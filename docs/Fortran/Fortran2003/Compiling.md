### Will GCC gfortran 8.3.0 compile Fortran 2003?

Yes, the GCC gfortran 8.3.0 compiler is capable of compiling Fortran 2003 code¹³. The gfortran compiler is part of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and it supports a significant number of Fortran 2003 features³. It's worth noting that while it fully supports the Fortran 95 standard, there might be some Fortran 2003 features that are not implemented³. Therefore, it's recommended to check the specific Fortran 2003 features you intend to use against the gfortran documentation².
