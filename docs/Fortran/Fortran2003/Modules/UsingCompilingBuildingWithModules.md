### For a Fortran 2003 are files with extension .mod used strictly for Modules and how do you include modules and compile them?

Yes, in Fortran, files with the `.mod` extension are used for modules¹². These module intermediate files are generated by the compiler when you compile source code that defines one or more modules². They contain information about the interfaces and variables of the modules, which the compiler needs to compile the source code that uses these modules².

To include and compile modules in Fortran, you can follow these steps:

1. **Compile the module file**: This will produce an object file (`.o`) and a module file (`.mod`). For example, if you have a module in a file named `mymodule.f90`, you can compile it with the following command⁵:

```bash
gfortran -c mymodule.f90
```

2. **Compile the main program**: When compiling the main program that uses the module, you need to tell the compiler where it can find the module file. You can do this using the `-I` option followed by the directory where the module file is located². For example, if your main program is in a file named `main.f90` and the module file is in the same directory, you can compile the main program with the following command²:

```bash
gfortran -c main.f90 -I .
```

3. **Link the program**: Finally, you can link the program with the following command³:

```bash
gfortran main.o mymodule.o
```

This will produce an executable file. If your program code is organized in different subdirectories, the module files might get scattered over the directory tree, complicating the compilation process. To avoid this, many compilers allow you to specify the output location for these files. For gfortran, you can use the `-J` option to do this². For example:

```bash
gfortran -c mymodule.f90 -J ../include
```

This command will put the `.mod` files in the `../include` directory².
