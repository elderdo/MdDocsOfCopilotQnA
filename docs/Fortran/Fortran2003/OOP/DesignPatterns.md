### Are the any Design Patterns adopted by Fortran 2003? If so, can you give a few examples?

Yes, there are several design patterns that have been adopted in Fortran 2003. Here are a few examples:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: This pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object. It's used where only a single instance of a class is required to control actions³.

2. **Strategy Pattern**: This pattern enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable³.

3. **Decorator Pattern**: This pattern allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class³.

4. **Factory Pattern**: This pattern deals with the problem of creating objects (product) without specifying the exact class of object that will be created³.

5. **Semi-Discrete Pattern**: This pattern supports the time advancement of a dynamical system encapsulated in a single abstract data type (ADT)¹.

6. **Puppeteer Pattern**: This pattern combines ADTs into a multiphysics package, mediates interabstraction communications, and enables implicit marching even when nonlinear terms couple separate ADTs with private data¹.

7. **Surrogate Pattern**: This pattern emulates C++ forward references in Fortran 2003¹.

These patterns provide solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design and can be particularly useful in multiphysics modeling¹. They help manage complexity by providing logical separation between individual physics models and the control logic that bridges between them¹.
