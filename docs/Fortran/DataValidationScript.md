### Is there a C, Perl, Python, sed, awk, or regex script that would validate data using a fortran FORMAT specification for a READ to check a file for fields that do not comply with the specified format?

While there isn't a specific script readily available that validates data using a Fortran FORMAT specification for a READ operation, you can create a custom script in languages like Python, Perl, or use tools like sed, awk, or regex. These tools are powerful for text processing and can be used to validate data formatsÂ¹.

Here's a simple example of how you might approach this in Python:

```python
import re

def validate_data(data, format_spec):
    # Create a regex pattern based on the Fortran FORMAT specification
    pattern = create_regex_pattern(format_spec)

    # Validate the data
    if re.match(pattern, data):
        print("Data is valid.")
    else:
        print("Data is invalid.")

def create_regex_pattern(format_spec):
    # Convert the Fortran FORMAT specification into a regex pattern
    # This is a simplified example and may need to be expanded based on the actual Fortran FORMAT specification
    pattern = format_spec.replace('I', '\d+')
    return pattern
```

In this example, the `create_regex_pattern` function converts the Fortran FORMAT specification into a regex pattern, replacing 'I' (which represents an integer in Fortran) with '\d+' (which represents one or more digits in regex). The `validate_data` function then uses this pattern to check if the data matches the expected format.

Please note that this is a simplified example and might not cover all possible Fortran FORMAT specifications. You would need to expand the `create_regex_pattern` function to handle other format specifiers as needed.

Remember to test your script thoroughly with various data inputs to ensure it works as expected. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask.

### Is there a C, Perl, Python, sed, awk, or regex script that would validate data using a fortran FORMAT specification for a READ to check a file for fields that do not comply with the specified format? Can you provide a basic example that would include a fortran format with multiple Integer specifications with I1, I2, or I3 digits , the character specification of A1, A2, or A3 and a decimal format with a specification of F10.2?

Sure, I can provide a basic Python script that could be used to validate data using a Fortran FORMAT specification. This script will handle integer specifications (I1, I2, I3), character specifications (A1, A2, A3), and decimal format (F10.2).

Here's a simplified example:

```python
import re

def validate_data(data, format_spec):
    # Create a regex pattern based on the Fortran FORMAT specification
    pattern = create_regex_pattern(format_spec)

    # Validate the data
    if re.match(pattern, data):
        print("Data is valid.")
    else:
        print("Data is invalid.")

def create_regex_pattern(format_spec):
    # Convert the Fortran FORMAT specification into a regex pattern
    # This is a simplified example and may need to be expanded based on the actual Fortran FORMAT specification
    pattern = format_spec
    pattern = re.sub(r'I\d+', r'\d+', pattern)  # Replace integer format specifiers with regex for one or more digits
    pattern = re.sub(r'A\d+', r'.+', pattern)  # Replace character format specifiers with regex for any character
    pattern = pattern.replace('F10.2', r'\d{1,8}\.\d{1,2}')  # Replace decimal format specifier with regex for a number with up to 8 digits before the decimal point and up to 2 digits after
    return pattern
```

In this example, the `create_regex_pattern` function converts the Fortran FORMAT specification into a regex pattern. It replaces 'I\d+' (which represents an integer of any length in Fortran) with '\d+' (which represents one or more digits in regex), 'A\d+' (which represents a character of any length in Fortran) with '.+' (which represents any character in regex), and 'F10.2' (which represents a decimal number in Fortran) with '\d{1,8}\.\d{1,2}' (which represents a number with up to 8 digits before the decimal point and up to 2 digits after in regex). The `validate_data` function then uses this pattern to check if the data matches the expected format.

Please note that this is a simplified example and might not cover all possible Fortran FORMAT specifications. You would need to expand the `create_regex_pattern` function to handle other format specifiers as needed.

### Is there a C, Perl, Python, sed, awk, or regex script that would validate data using a fortran FORMAT specification for a READ to check a file for fields that do not comply with the specified format? Can you provide a basic example that would include a fortran format with multiple Integer specifications with I1, I2, or I3 digits , the character specification of A1, A2, or A3 and a decimal format with a specification of F10.2? If one of the pattern fails, is there a way to identify which a field or multiple fields fail to match the specified FORMAT?

Sure, I can modify the previous Python script to identify which field or fields fail to match the specified format. This script will handle integer specifications (I1, I2, I3), character specifications (A1, A2, A3), and decimal format (F10.2).

Here's an updated example:

```python
import re

def validate_data(data, format_spec):
    # Create a regex pattern based on the Fortran FORMAT specification
    pattern = create_regex_pattern(format_spec)

    # Split the data and the pattern into fields
    data_fields = data.split()
    pattern_fields = pattern.split()

    # Validate each field
    for data_field, pattern_field in zip(data_fields, pattern_fields):
        if not re.match(pattern_field, data_field):
            print(f"Data field '{data_field}' is invalid. Expected format: '{pattern_field}'")

def create_regex_pattern(format_spec):
    # Convert the Fortran FORMAT specification into a regex pattern
    # This is a simplified example and may need to be expanded based on the actual Fortran FORMAT specification
    pattern = format_spec
    pattern = re.sub(r'I\d+', r'\d+', pattern)  # Replace integer format specifiers with regex for one or more digits
    pattern = re.sub(r'A\d+', r'.+', pattern)  # Replace character format specifiers with regex for any character
    pattern = pattern.replace('F10.2', r'\d{1,8}\.\d{1,2}')  # Replace decimal format specifier with regex for a number with up to 8 digits before the decimal point and up to 2 digits after
    return pattern
```

In this updated example, the `validate_data` function splits the data and the pattern into fields and validates each field individually. If a field does not match the expected format, it prints a message indicating which field is invalid and what the expected format is.

Please note that this is a simplified example and might not cover all possible Fortran FORMAT specifications. You would need to expand the `create_regex_pattern` function to handle other format specifiers as needed.

Remember to test your script thoroughly with various data inputs to ensure it works as expected. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask.

### Is there a C, Perl, Python, sed, awk, or regex script that would validate data using a fortran FORMAT specification for a READ to check a file for fields that do not comply with the specified format? Can you provide a basic example that would include a fortran format with multiple Integer specifications with I1, I2, or I3 digits , the character specification of A1, A2, or A3 and a decimal format with a specification of F10.2? If one of the pattern fails, is there a way to identify which a field or multiple fields fail to match the specified FORMAT? What would be a simple data file reader that validates all rows and reports the fields and for what rows in the file? I am not proficient with Python so an opening a file by name would help my understanding and have the script be executable with the Python interpreter.

Sure, I can provide a Python script that reads a data file, validates each row according to a Fortran FORMAT specification, and reports any fields that do not comply with the format. Here's an example:

```python
import re

def validate_data_file(file_name, format_spec):
    # Create a regex pattern based on the Fortran FORMAT specification
    pattern = create_regex_pattern(format_spec)

    # Open the data file
    with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
        # Read each line (row) in the file
        for line_number, line in enumerate(file, start=1):
            # Split the line and the pattern into fields
            line_fields = line.split()
            pattern_fields = pattern.split()

            # Validate each field
            for field_number, (line_field, pattern_field) in enumerate(zip(line_fields, pattern_fields), start=1):
                if not re.match(pattern_field, line_field):
                    print(f"Row {line_number}, Field {field_number} ('{line_field}') is invalid. Expected format: '{pattern_field}'")

def create_regex_pattern(format_spec):
    # Convert the Fortran FORMAT specification into a regex pattern
    # This is a simplified example and may need to be expanded based on the actual Fortran FORMAT specification
    pattern = format_spec
    pattern = re.sub(r'I\d+', r'\d+', pattern)  # Replace integer format specifiers with regex for one or more digits
    pattern = re.sub(r'A\d+', r'.+', pattern)  # Replace character format specifiers with regex for any character
    pattern = pattern.replace('F10.2', r'\d{1,8}\.\d{1,2}')  # Replace decimal format specifier with regex for a number with up to 8 digits before the decimal point and up to 2 digits after
    return pattern
```

In this script, you would call `validate_data_file` with the name of the data file and the Fortran FORMAT specification as arguments. For example:

```python
validate_data_file('data.txt', 'I1 I2 I3 A1 A2 A3 F10.2')
```

This script will read each line in the data file, split it into fields, and validate each field against the corresponding part of the regex pattern. If a field does not match the expected format, it will print a message indicating the row number, field number, the invalid data, and the expected format.

Please note that this is a simplified example and might not cover all possible Fortran FORMAT specifications. You would need to expand the `create_regex_pattern` function to handle other format specifiers as needed.

Remember to test your script thoroughly with various data inputs to ensure it works as expected. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Also, please replace `'data.txt'` with the actual path to your data file. If the data file is not in the same directory as your Python script, you will need to provide the full path to the file. For example, on a Windows system, it might look something like this: `'C:\\Users\\YourName\\Documents\\data.txt'`. On a Unix-based system like Linux or macOS, it might look like this: `'/home/yourname/Documents/data.txt'`.
