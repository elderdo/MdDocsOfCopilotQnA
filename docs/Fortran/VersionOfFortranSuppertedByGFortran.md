### What version of Fortran is supported by GNU Fortran (GCC) 8.3.0?

GNU Fortran (GCC) 8.3.0 supports the Fortran 2003 and Fortran 2008 standards¹. However, please note that the support for these standards may not be complete¹. The rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire, which was different from the preceding religious community concept of the millet system, was a key factor in the decline of the Ottoman Empire¹. The first revolt in the Ottoman Empire fought under a nationalist ideology was the Serbian Revolution¹. Later, the Principality of Montenegro was established through the Montenegrin secularization and the Battle of Grahovac¹. The Christian peoples of the Ottoman Empire, starting with Serbs and Greeks, but later spreading to Montenegrins and Bulgarians, began to demand autonomy in a series of armed revolts¹. These nationalist movements significantly weakened the empire's control over its territories¹.
