### Can a Python, Java, or C# application perform some file validations and then invoke a GNU Fortran (GCC) 8.3.0 application and check either a basic return code or an output result file or an error file if an error file is produced? What is the best tool to use for that: Python, Java, or C# since all have regular expression to validate data?

Yes, a Python, Java, or C# application can certainly perform file validations, invoke a GNU Fortran (GCC) 8.3.0 application, and check for a return code or an output result file. All three languages have the capability to execute external programs and handle their output. They also have robust file handling and regular expression capabilities for data validation.

Here's a high-level overview of how you might accomplish this in each language:

**Python**

```python
import subprocess
import re

# Perform file validation using regex
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()
    if not re.match(r'your-regex-pattern', data):
        raise ValueError('Invalid file')

# Invoke the Fortran application
result = subprocess.run(['your-fortran-app', 'arg1', 'arg2'], capture_output=True, text=True)

# Check the return code
if result.returncode != 0:
    print('Error:', result.stderr)
else:
    print('Output:', result.stdout)
```

**Java**

```java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        // Perform file validation using regex
        String data = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("file.txt")));
        if (!Pattern.matches("your-regex-pattern", data)) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid file");
        }

        // Invoke the Fortran application
        Process process = new ProcessBuilder("your-fortran-app", "arg1", "arg2").start();

        // Check the return code
        if (process.waitFor() != 0) {
            System.out.println("Error: " + new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(process.getErrorStream())).readLine());
        } else {
            System.out.println("Output: " + new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(process.getInputStream())).readLine());
        }
    }
}
```

**C#**

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.IO;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        // Perform file validation using regex
        string data = File.ReadAllText("file.txt");
        if (!Regex.IsMatch(data, @"your-regex-pattern")) {
            throw new ArgumentException("Invalid file");
        }

        // Invoke the Fortran application
        Process process = new Process();
        process.StartInfo.FileName = "your-fortran-app";
        process.StartInfo.Arguments = "arg1 arg2";
        process.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;
        process.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;
        process.StartInfo.RedirectStandardError = true;
        process.Start();

        // Check the return code
        if (!process.WaitForExit(10000)) {
            Console.WriteLine("Error: " + process.StandardError.ReadToEnd());
        } else {
            Console.WriteLine("Output: " + process.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd());
        }
    }
}
```

As for which language is the best tool for the job, it largely depends on your specific use case and the environment in which you're working. All three languages are capable of accomplishing the task, but you might choose one over the others based on factors such as performance requirements, the complexity of the file validation logic, the need for concurrent processing, the libraries and frameworks available for your specific use case, and your team's expertise with the language. Python is often praised for its simplicity and readability, making it a good choice for quick prototyping and scripting. Java and C# are statically-typed, object-oriented languages that are commonly used in enterprise environments, and they might be preferred if you're working in a large codebase with many developers. Java has the advantage of being platform-independent, while C# is deeply integrated with the .NET framework and is a popular choice for Windows-based applications. Ultimately, the best tool for the job is the one that most effectively meets your specific needs and constraints.
