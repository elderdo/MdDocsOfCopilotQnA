### question

For Fortran applications what determines if a file is being used as input or output? Can you give me examples of both input and output files?

### answer

In Fortran, whether a file is used as input or output is determined by the **OPEN** statement's **ACTION** and **STATUS** specifiers.

### Determining Input or Output:

- **Input File**: Use `ACTION='READ'` or `STATUS='OLD'` to open an existing file for reading.
- **Output File**: Use `ACTION='WRITE'` or `STATUS='NEW'` to create a new file for writing, or `STATUS='REPLACE'` to overwrite an existing file.

### Examples:

#### Input File:

```fortran
PROGRAM ReadData
  INTEGER :: io
  REAL :: a, b
  OPEN(UNIT=10, FILE='input.dat', STATUS='OLD', ACTION='READ')
  READ(10, *) a, b
  CLOSE(10)
END PROGRAM ReadData
```

This program opens an existing file `input.dat` for reading and reads two real numbers from it.

#### Output File:

```fortran
PROGRAM WriteData
  INTEGER :: io
  REAL :: x(100), y(100)
  INTEGER :: i
  DO i = 1, 100
    x(i) = i * 0.1
    y(i) = SIN(x(i))
  END DO
  OPEN(UNIT=20, FILE='output.dat', STATUS='NEW', ACTION='WRITE')
  DO i = 1, 100
    WRITE(20, *) x(i), y(i)
  END DO
  CLOSE(20)
END PROGRAM WriteData
```

This program creates a new file `output.dat` and writes the values of arrays `x` and `y` into it.

These examples illustrate how to handle file input and output in Fortran¹².
