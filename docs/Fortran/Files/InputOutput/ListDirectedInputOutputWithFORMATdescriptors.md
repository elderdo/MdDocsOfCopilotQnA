### I need a Fortran refresher regarding list directed I/O. If I have 9919 FORMAT (A1,I6,F10.2) what should the file look like to conform to that format. Is an explicit decimal point required or can it be implied?

In Fortran, the `FORMAT` statement you provided, `9919 FORMAT (A1,I6,F10.2)`, specifies the following:

- `A1`: A single character
- `I6`: An integer with up to 6 digits
- `F10.2`: A floating-point number with a total of 10 digits, 2 of which are after the decimal point²

An example of a line in a file that conforms to this format could be:

```
A123456  1234.56
```

Here, `A` is the single character, `123456` is the integer, and `1234.56` is the floating-point number. Note that there are two spaces before the floating-point number to fill the total field width of 10.

Regarding your question about the decimal point, in the `F10.2` format, the decimal point is not explicitly required in the input. If it's not present, Fortran will interpret the number as having two decimal places. For example, if the input is `123456`, it will be interpreted as `1234.56`. However, it's generally good practice to include the decimal point for clarity².

### For Fortran with a 9919 FORMAT (F10.2) for a READ are 10 characters required? If there are 10 digits does the result have a precision of 10 and a scale of 2?

In Fortran, the `FORMAT` statement `9919 FORMAT (F10.2)` for a `READ` operation specifies a floating-point number with a total field width of 10 characters, including the decimal point and any sign. This means that up to 10 characters are expected for the input¹².

The `F10.2` format specifies a floating-point number with a total of 10 digits, 2 of which are after the decimal point². The precision of the number is determined by the total number of digits in the number, while the scale is determined by the number of digits after the decimal point².

So, if there are 10 digits in the number, the precision would be 10, and the scale would be 2, as specified by the `.2` in the `F10.2` format. If the number has more than 8 digits before the decimal point or more than 2 digits after the decimal point, it will be rounded to fit the `F10.2` format². If the number requires more spaces than specified by the descriptor, the entire field is filled with asterisks².

Please note that the actual precision of the number in memory can be greater than the precision specified in the `FORMAT` statement, as the `FORMAT` statement only controls the appearance of the number when it's read from or written to a file or the console². The actual precision and range of floating-point numbers in memory are determined by the specific Fortran implementation and the kind of the number⁵.

### For Fortran with a 9919 FORMAT (F10.2) for a READ are 10 characters required? If there are 10 digits does the result have a precision of 10 and a scale of 2? So, an input of 1234567890 would be taken as 12,345,678.90 Is that correct?

No, that's not correct. The `F10.2` format in Fortran specifies a floating-point number with a total of 10 characters, including the decimal point and any sign. This means that the number `1234567890` would not fit into this format because it has more than 8 digits before the decimal point.

If you try to read a number like `1234567890` with the `F10.2` format, the number would be too large for the specified format and the result would be undefined according to the Fortran standard. In practice, many Fortran compilers would either give an error or fill the field with asterisks.

If you want to read the number `1234567890` as `12345678.90`, you would need to use a format like `F11.2` (or larger), which allows for 9 digits before the decimal point, the decimal point itself, and 2 digits after the decimal point. However, please note that the input should include the decimal point at the appropriate position, i.e., the input should be `12345678.90`, not `1234567890`.
