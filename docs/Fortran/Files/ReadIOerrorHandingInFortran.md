### For GNU Fortran (GCC) 8.3.0 does it support any exception option for a READ of a file and report what record number caused the exception?

GNU Fortran (GCC) 8.3.0 does not provide a built-in mechanism to handle exceptions during a file read operation and report the record number that caused the exception. Exception handling in Fortran is typically done using the `IOSTAT` and `ERR` specifiers in the `READ` statement¹.

Here's an example of how you might use these specifiers to handle exceptions:

```fortran
PROGRAM ReadFile
    IMPLICIT NONE
    INTEGER :: iostat, record_number
    CHARACTER(LEN=100) :: line

    OPEN(UNIT=10, FILE='data.txt', STATUS='OLD', ACTION='READ')

    record_number = 0
    DO
        READ(10, '(A)', IOSTAT=iostat, ERR=100) line
        IF (iostat < 0) EXIT  ! End of file
        IF (iostat > 0) THEN  ! An error occurred
            PRINT *, 'Error on record number ', record_number
            STOP
        END IF
        record_number = record_number + 1
    END DO

    CLOSE(10)
    STOP

100 PRINT *, 'An error occurred while opening the file.'
END PROGRAM ReadFile
```

In this example, the `READ` statement attempts to read a line from the file. If an error occurs during the read operation (such as if the file does not exist or is not readable), the `IOSTAT` specifier causes the `iostat` variable to be set to a positive value, and the `ERR` specifier causes execution to jump to the label `100`. If the end of the file is reached, `iostat` is set to a negative value.

Please note that this is a simplified example and might not cover all possible exceptions that can occur during a file read operation. You would need to expand this code to handle other exceptions as needed. Also, please replace `'data.txt'` with the actual path to your data file. If the data file is not in the same directory as your Fortran program, you will need to provide the full path to the file¹.
