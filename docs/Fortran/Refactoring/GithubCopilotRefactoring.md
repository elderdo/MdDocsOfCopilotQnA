### question
Can github copilot refactor fortran code?

### answer

GitHub Copilot can assist with refactoring Fortran code, but it may not be as effective as with more commonly used languages like Python, JavaScript, or C#. Copilot's suggestions are based on patterns it has learned from a vast amount of code, so it can help with some refactoring tasks in Fortran, especially if the code follows common patterns.

However, for more specialized or extensive refactoring of Fortran code, you might want to consider using dedicated tools like [RefactorF4Acc](https://github.com/wimvanderbauwhede/RefactorF4Acc), which is designed to make legacy Fortran code acceleration-ready⁵.

If you have specific Fortran code snippets you'd like to refactor, you can try using Copilot to see if it provides helpful suggestions.
