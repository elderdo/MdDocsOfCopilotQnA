### Does Fortran 2003 have reflection or does it have something similar that IOC can be applied and classes injected into interfaces?

Fortran 2003 introduced many modern features, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), but it does not support reflection in the same way as languages like Java or C# do⁵⁶. Reflection, as a feature that allows a program to inspect and modify its structure and behavior at runtime, is not available in Fortran 2003⁵⁶.

As for Inversion of Control (IoC) and dependency injection, these are design patterns often used in conjunction with reflection in some languages. However, Fortran 2003 does not natively support these patterns due to its lack of reflection⁵⁶.

In terms of interfaces, Fortran 2003 does support abstract interfaces¹. These can be used to declare interfaces for procedures and deferred bindings¹. However, the concept of injecting classes into interfaces, as it is known in languages like Java or C#, does not directly translate to Fortran 2003¹.

While Fortran 2003 does not support these specific features, it does offer other powerful features such as procedure pointers, interoperability with C, and object-oriented programming constructs like type extension and inheritance⁶⁸. These features can be used to design flexible and reusable software components⁶⁸. However, they do not provide the same capabilities as reflection or IoC as found in some other languages⁵⁶.
