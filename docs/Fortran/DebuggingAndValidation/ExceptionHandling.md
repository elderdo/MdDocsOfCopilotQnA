### For Fortran 2003 Exception Handling can it be used with a READ statement that uses numbered FORMATS to capture data exceptions for Integers or other numeric data?

Yes, you can use exception handling with a `READ` statement in Fortran 2003. The `READ` statement can include an `iostat` and `iomsg` clause to capture data exceptions². Here is an example:

```fortran
INTEGER :: iostat
CHARACTER(LEN=256) :: iomsg
INTEGER :: data

READ(*,*, iostat=iostat, iomsg=iomsg) data
IF (iostat /= 0) THEN
    PRINT *, "An error occurred: ", TRIM(iomsg)
END IF
```

In this example, the `READ` statement attempts to read an integer from the standard input. If the input is not a valid integer, `iostat` will be non-zero, and `iomsg` will contain a brief error message. The `IF` statement then checks `iostat` and prints the error message if an error occurred.

Please note that the length required for the message character (`iomsg`) is vendor and error dependent². Also, remember to compile your Fortran program with a compiler that supports Fortran 2003 to use these features.
