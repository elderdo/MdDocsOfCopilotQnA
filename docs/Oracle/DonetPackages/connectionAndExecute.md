### question

When using C# .NET framework, what packages are required for connecting to Oracle and executing INSERTs?

### answer

To connect to an Oracle database and execute INSERT statements using C# .NET Framework, you will need the following packages:

1. **Oracle Data Provider for .NET (ODP.NET)**:

   - **Oracle.ManagedDataAccess**: This is the main package for connecting to Oracle databases.
   - **Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.EntityFramework**: If you are using Entity Framework, this package is required.

2. **Dapper** (optional):
   - **Dapper**: A lightweight ORM that can be used for executing SQL queries and commands in a more efficient manner.

You can install these packages via NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio:

```bash
Install-Package Oracle.ManagedDataAccess
Install-Package Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.EntityFramework
Install-Package Dapper
```

For more detailed information, you can refer to the [Oracle Data Provider for .NET documentation](https://www.oracle.com/tools/technologies/quickstart-dotnet-for-oracle-database.html)¹²³.
