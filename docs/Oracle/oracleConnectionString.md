### request

Give me an example of an Oracle connection string with password using in a C# appsettings.

### response

Sure! Here's an example of how you can include an Oracle connection string with a password in a C# `appsettings.json` file:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "OracleDbConnection": "User Id=username;Password=password;Data Source=(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=hostname)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=orcl)))"
  }
}
```

Replace `username`, `password`, `hostname`, and `orcl` with your actual database details.

Let me know if you need any more help!
