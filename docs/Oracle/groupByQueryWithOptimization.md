### question

Here's an Oracle query:

```sql
select crib, count(*)
from trans
where typedescription in ('ISSRT', 'ISSUE','RETN','RETNW')
and crib in ('808','817','8118')
and to_date(transdate,'mm/dd/yyyy') = '09/17/2024'
group by rollup (crib);
```

Can you optimize it using Oracle functions so that it is efficient yet does basically the same functionality?

### answer

Certainly! Here's an optimized version of your Oracle query using Oracle functions:

```sql
SELECT crib, COUNT(*)
FROM trans
WHERE typedescription IN ('ISSRT', 'ISSUE', 'RETN', 'RETNW')
  AND crib IN ('808', '817', '8118')
  AND transdate = TO_DATE('09/17/2024', 'MM/DD/YYYY')
GROUP BY ROLLUP (crib);
```

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed unnecessary `to_date` conversion**: Since `transdate` is already a date column, we can directly compare it with a date literal.
2. **Formatted the date literal**: Used `TO_DATE` function to ensure the date format is correctly interpreted.

This should improve the efficiency while maintaining the same functionality.
