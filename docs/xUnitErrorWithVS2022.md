### I am using VS 2022, a simple console app, and a Class Library project with a [FACT] attribute for C#, it fails to run the test and I get a popup dialog saying "ServiceHub.LiveUnitTesting.exe has stopped working". Also, when I check the VS 2022 Test explorer, it shows the test in the "not run" category with the blue diamond containing an exclamation mark in the VS 2022 Test Explorer window. Is this a xUnit bug or a VS 2022 bug with a known solution? My code is in this repo: https://github.com/elderdo/xUnitExampleApps

The issue you're experiencing with "ServiceHub.LiveUnitTesting.exe has stopped working" and tests not running in Visual Studio 2022 could be due to several reasons. Here are some potential solutions:

1. **Update .NET Framework Version**: Ensure that the .NET Framework version installed on your machine matches the version required by your xUnit tests⁶.

2. **Check Dependencies and Configurations**: Verify that you have the required dependencies installed and your test configuration is correct⁶.

3. **Fix Broken Tests**: If there are any broken tests in your project, fixing them might resolve the issue⁶.

4. **Reinstall or Update VS 2022**: There have been instances where updating or reinstalling Visual Studio 2022 resolved similar issues².

5. **Check xUnit Attributes**: Ensure you're using the correct method attributes for xUnit. xUnit uses `[Fact]` / `[Theory]` only on methods, and doesn't use any attributes on test class types⁹.

6. **Configure Live Unit Testing**: You can configure Live Unit Testing by going to Test > Live Unit Testing > Configure Live Unit Testing for solution when Live Unit Testing is stopped¹.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, it might be helpful to post a detailed question on the Visual Studio Developer Community or Stack Overflow, including the specific error messages and any relevant code snippets. This will allow other developers who have encountered similar issues to provide guidance. Remember to always keep your software up-to-date and regularly check for any patches or updates that might resolve your issue.
