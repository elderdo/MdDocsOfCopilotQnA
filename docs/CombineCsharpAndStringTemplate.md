What is the best tool to use to read csv files with C# and utilize that data in conjection with stringtemplate to map the csv fields to the arguments of some script?

To read CSV files in C#, you can use the `CsvHelper` library³. It is a popular open-source library that is fast, flexible, and easy to use. It provides features to customize the CSV parsing and writing process³.

Here's a basic example of how you might use `CsvHelper` to read a CSV file:

```csharp
using CsvHelper;
using System.IO;
using System.Collections.Generic;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        using (var reader = new StreamReader("path\\to\\your\\file.csv"))
        using (var csv = new CsvReader(reader, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture))
        {
            var records = csv.GetRecords<dynamic>();
            foreach (var record in records)
            {
                // Use record here...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Once you have read the CSV file into a suitable data structure (like a list of dictionaries or a DataTable), you can use the `StringTemplate` library to map the CSV fields to the arguments of some script. Here's a basic example:

```csharp
using Antlr4.StringTemplate;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var template = new Template("Hello, <name>!");
        template.Add("name", "World");
        var result = template.Render();
        Console.WriteLine(result);  // Outputs: Hello, World!
    }
}
```

In this example, `name` is a placeholder in the template that gets replaced with "World". In your case, you would replace "name" with the names of the fields from your CSV file, and "World" with the corresponding values from each record.

Remember to add the necessary using directives for `CsvHelper` and `StringTemplate` at the top of your C# file. You'll also need to install these libraries via NuGet if you haven't already done so.

Please note that this is a simplified example. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to adjust this code to suit your needs. For instance, if your CSV file has a header row, you'll need to skip the first row when reading the file. If your CSV data needs to be converted to specific data types, you'll need to handle that as well. Similarly, your string templates might be more complex and require additional handling.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
