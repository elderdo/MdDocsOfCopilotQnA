### What's the procedure for deploying a C# Xamarin app to a device? Can you point me to some tutorials that explain that process?

Sure, here are some resources that can guide you through the process of deploying a C# Xamarin app to a device:

1. **Xamarin Forms #2- How to Configure your Mobile Device**¹: This video tutorial explains how to configure an Android device and use it as an emulator for Visual Studio 2019.

2. **Xamarin Tutorial for Beginners - Build iOS & Android Apps with C#, Visual Studio, and Xamarin.Forms**²: This comprehensive video tutorial covers creating a cross-platform mobile app with Xamarin, Xamarin.Forms, C#, and Visual Studio, including deploying and debugging the app on Android and iOS devices or simulators.

3. **Build Your First iOS App Using C# and Xamarin (Xamarin.iOS)**³: This video tutorial guides you through building your first iOS app using C# and Xamarin.iOS in 20 minutes.

4. **Deploying and Running Your First C# Xamarin Mobile App | Twilio**⁴: This blog post shows you how to deploy and run your Xamarin app on an iPhone or Android device, as well as on iOS and Android emulators.

5. **How to Publish or Deploy Xamarin android app to my phone samsung galaxy s3 - Stack Overflow**⁵: This Stack Overflow thread provides steps to move your application (.apk) file to an Android phone and run it.

Remember, deploying a Xamarin app involves more than just coding and pressing F5. Since your apps will be running on a mobile operating system like Android or iOS, testing and debugging them requires running them on a device running one of those operating systems or a simulation of a device⁴.
