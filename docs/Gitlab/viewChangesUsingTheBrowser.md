### question

Using Gitlab how do I see what code has changed and the explicit changes per each file for a particular branch using the browser for the Gitlab?

### answer

To see what code has changed and the explicit changes per each file for a particular branch in GitLab using the browser, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to Your Project**:

   - On the left sidebar, select **Search or go to** and find your project.

2. **View the Repository**:

   - Select **Code > Repository**.

3. **Select the Branch**:

   - Use the branch dropdown to select the branch you want to view.

4. **View Changes in Merge Requests**:

   - If you are looking at changes in a merge request, select **Code > Merge requests** and find your merge request.
   - Below the merge request title, select **Changes**.
   - This will show you a diff (difference) between the current state and the proposed changes. The current version is shown in red with a minus (-) sign, and the proposed version is shown in green with a plus (+) sign⁴.

5. **View File History**:

   - To see a file’s Git history, go to your desired file in the repository.
   - In the upper-right corner, select **History**⁶.

6. **Show a List of Changed Files**:
   - Use the file browser to view a list of files changed in a merge request. Select **Show file browser** or press `F` to show the file tree⁴.

These steps should help you see the code changes and the explicit changes per each file for a particular branch in GitLab using the browser. If you need more detailed instructions, you can refer to the [GitLab documentation](^4^).
