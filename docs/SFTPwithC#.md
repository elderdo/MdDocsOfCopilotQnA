Yes, there is a NuGet library called **SSH.NET** that allows an application to perform Secure Shell (SSH) commands like SFTP⁵. This library is optimized for parallelism and provides SFTP functionality for both synchronous and asynchronous operations⁵.

Here is a simple example of how you might use SSH.NET to perform an SFTP file transfer:

```csharp
using Renci.SshNet;
using System.IO;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var connectionInfo = new ConnectionInfo("sftp.example.com", "username",
            new PasswordAuthenticationMethod("username", "password"));

        using (var sftp = new SftpClient(connectionInfo))
        {
            sftp.Connect();
            using (var fileStream = new FileStream(@"C:\local\path\file.txt", FileMode.Open))
            {
                sftp.UploadFile(fileStream, "/remote/path/file.txt");
            }
            sftp.Disconnect();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, replace `"sftp.example.com"`, `"username"`, `"password"`, `"C:\\local\\path\\file.txt"`, and `"/remote/path/file.txt"` with your own SFTP server details and the local and remote file paths. This code connects to the SFTP server using the provided credentials, uploads a file, and then disconnects.

Please note that this is a basic example. In a real-world application, you would want to add error checking and possibly additional functionality. Also, remember to install the SSH.NET NuGet package in your project before using this code. You can do this in Visual Studio by right-clicking on your project in Solution Explorer, selecting "Manage NuGet Packages...", and then searching for and installing SSH.NET.

Yes, SSH.NET can perform SFTP operations using a private and public key pair without a password. You can use the `PrivateKeyFile` class in SSH.NET to authenticate with a private key. Here's an example:

```csharp
using Renci.SshNet;
using System.IO;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var keyFile = new PrivateKeyFile(@"C:\path\to\private\key.pem");
        var keyFiles = new[] { keyFile };
        var methods = new List<AuthenticationMethod>();
        methods.Add(new PrivateKeyAuthenticationMethod("username", keyFiles));

        var con = new ConnectionInfo("sftp.example.com", "username", methods.ToArray());

        using (var sftp = new SftpClient(con))
        {
            sftp.Connect();
            using (var fileStream = new FileStream(@"C:\local\path\file.txt", FileMode.Open))
            {
                sftp.UploadFile(fileStream, "/remote/path/file.txt");
            }
            sftp.Disconnect();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, replace `"sftp.example.com"`, `"username"`, `"C:\\path\\to\\private\\key.pem"`, `"C:\\local\\path\\file.txt"`, and `"/remote/path/file.txt"` with your own SFTP server details, username, path to your private key, and the local and remote file paths. This code connects to the SFTP server using the provided private key, uploads a file, and then disconnects.

Please note that this is a basic example. In a real-world application, you would want to add error checking and possibly additional functionality. Also, remember to install the SSH.NET NuGet package in your project before using this code. You can do this in Visual Studio by right-clicking on your project in Solution Explorer, selecting "Manage NuGet Packages...", and then searching for and installing SSH.NET.

Can the SSH.NET generate a public and private key pair? If it can, please show an example.

SSH.NET itself does not provide a built-in method to generate a public and private key pair. However, you can use other tools or libraries to generate the key pair and then use it with SSH.NET.

For instance, you can use the `ssh-keygen` tool available on Unix-based systems (including Linux and MacOS) and also on Windows through Git Bash or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Here's an example of how to generate a key pair using `ssh-keygen`:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
```

This command generates a 2048-bit RSA key pair³. You'll be prompted to enter a file path to save the key, and you can press enter to accept the default location. You'll also be prompted to enter an optional passphrase for added security.

If you need to generate the keys programmatically in a .NET environment, you might need to use other libraries like Bouncy Castle or the built-in RSA class in .NET⁴. Here's an example using the RSA class:

```csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Generate a public/private key pair.
        RSA rsa = RSA.Create();

        // Save the public key information to an RSAParameters structure.
        RSAParameters rsaParams = rsa.ExportParameters(false);

        // rsaParams contains the public key information.
    }
}
```

In this example, the `rsaParams` variable contains the public key information. The private key is stored in the `rsa` object and can be exported similarly using `rsa.ExportParameters(true)`⁴.

Please note that these examples are basic and might need to be adapted to your specific needs. Always remember to secure your private keys and not to expose them publicly. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
