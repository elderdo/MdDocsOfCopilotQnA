Yes, there are open-source tools that can help parse PLM XML files produced by Teamcenter:

1. **Apache Xerces**: A widely used XML parser that can handle PLM XML files.
2. **lxml**: A Python library that provides a convenient API for XML and HTML parsing.
3. **xml.etree.ElementTree**: A lightweight Python module for parsing and creating XML data.
