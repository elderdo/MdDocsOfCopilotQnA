### When using VS Code and the dotnet command, how do you create user secrets for a C# project?

To create user secrets for a C# project using VS Code and the `dotnet` command, follow these steps:

1. **Initialize User Secrets**:
   - Open your project in VS Code.
   - Open the terminal and navigate to your project directory.
   - Run the following command to initialize user secrets:
     ```bash
     dotnet user-secrets init
     ```

2. **Set User Secrets**:
   - Use the following command to set a user secret:
     ```bash
     dotnet user-secrets set "YourSecretName" "YourSecretValue"
     ```

3. **Access User Secrets in Code**:
   - In your `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs`, add the following code to access the user secrets:
     ```csharp
     var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
         .AddUserSecrets<Program>();
     var configuration = builder.Build();
     var secretValue = configuration["YourSecretName"];
     ```

4. **Manage User Secrets**:
   - To view or edit your user secrets, you can find the `secrets.json` file in the following location:
     - Windows: `%APPDATA%\microsoft\UserSecrets\<userSecretsId>\secrets.json`
     - macOS/Linux: `~/.microsoft/usersecrets/<userSecretsId>/secrets.json`

These steps will help you securely manage sensitive data during development without storing them in your source code⁴⁵⁶.

### For a C# .NET 8 MVC application does the application automatically get the five different levels of configuration: command line, environment variables, appsettings for the environment, user secrets, and finally appsettings.json when the builder is created with
```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
```
regardless of what IDE is used to create the project: VS Code or VS 2022?  Does doing this:
```csharp
 var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
         .AddUserSecrets<Program>();
```         
override that hierarchy?


Yes, for a C# .NET 8 MVC application, when you create the builder with `var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);`, the application automatically gets the five different levels of configuration in the following order, from highest to lowest priority¹:

1. Command-line arguments
2. Environment variables
3. `appsettings.{Environment}.json`
4. User secrets (when the app runs in the Development environment)
5. `appsettings.json`

This hierarchy is applied regardless of the IDE used to create the project, whether it's VS Code or Visual Studio 2022¹.

When you use `var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder().AddUserSecrets<Program>();`, it does not override the default hierarchy. Instead, it adds user secrets to the configuration sources. However, if you explicitly configure the `ConfigurationBuilder` without including other sources, it will only use the sources you specify. To maintain the default hierarchy while adding user secrets, you should include all the necessary configuration sources in your `ConfigurationBuilder` setup⁹[^10^].

For example:
```csharp
var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true)
    .AddJsonFile($"appsettings.{Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT")}.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true)
    .AddEnvironmentVariables()
    .AddCommandLine(args)
    .AddUserSecrets<Program>();
```

This way, you ensure that the default configuration hierarchy is preserved while adding user secrets.
