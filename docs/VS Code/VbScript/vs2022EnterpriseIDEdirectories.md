### question

I have 64 bit VS 2022 Enterprise edition. What is the directory that contains the Just in time debugger when this is the path I have with many subdirectories: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Enterprise?

### answer

For Visual Studio 2022 Enterprise edition, the Just-In-Time (JIT) Debugger is typically located in the following directory:

`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\`

Make sure to add this path to your PATH environment variable to ensure the JIT Debugger is found first. If you encounter any issues, you might need to verify that Just-In-Time debugging is enabled in Visual Studio:

1. Open Visual Studio as an administrator.
2. Go to `Tools > Options > Debugging > Just-In-Time`.
3. Check the boxes for the types of code you want to debug (Managed, Native, Script).
4. Click "OK" to save the settings¹².
