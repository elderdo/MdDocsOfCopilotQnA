### question

When I run my vbscript with cscript /x getBenchStockData, I don't see the dialog for Visual Studio Just in Time Debugger. Is there more than one cscript.exe? If so, what directory contains the just in time debugger, since I would need to add it to the Path environment variable so it found first.

### answer

There is typically only one `cscript.exe` on a standard Windows installation, located in the `C:\Windows\System32` directory¹. However, if you have multiple versions of Windows or other software that includes its own version of `cscript.exe`, you might find additional instances.

To ensure the Just-In-Time (JIT) Debugger is found first, you need to add the directory containing the JIT Debugger to your PATH environment variable. The JIT Debugger is part of Visual Studio, and its executable is usually located in the Visual Studio installation directory. For example, it might be in a path like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\IDE\`⁶.

To add this directory to your PATH environment variable:

1. Open the Start Menu and search for "Environment Variables."
2. Select "Edit the system environment variables."
3. In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
4. In the Environment Variables window, find the "Path" variable in the "System variables" section and click "Edit."
5. Click "New" and add the path to the Visual Studio directory containing the JIT Debugger.
6. Click "OK" to close all windows.

After updating the PATH, try running your VBScript again with `cscript /x getBenchStockData`.

If you still don't see the JIT Debugger dialog, ensure that Just-In-Time debugging is enabled in Visual Studio:

1. Open Visual Studio as an administrator.
2. Go to `Tools > Options > Debugging > Just-In-Time`.
3. Check the boxes for the types of code you want to debug (Managed, Native, Script).
4. Click "OK" to save the settings⁷.

If you encounter any issues, you might need to repair your Visual Studio installation or check for any conflicting debuggers⁸.
