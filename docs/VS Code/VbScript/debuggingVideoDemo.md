### question

Is there a Youtube video demonstrating debuging vbscript with vs code? For some reason I am not able to set breakpoints with the required extension installed.

### answer

Yes, there is a YouTube video that demonstrates debugging VBScript with Visual Studio Code. You can check out this video: [How to Debug VBScript (Visual Studio)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsrxSlq1oys)ยน. It provides a step-by-step guide on how to set up and debug VBScript using Visual Studio.

If you're having trouble setting breakpoints, make sure you have the correct setup and follow the steps in the video. If the issue persists, you might want to check the extension's documentation or seek help from the community forums.

Is there anything else you'd like to know or need help with?
