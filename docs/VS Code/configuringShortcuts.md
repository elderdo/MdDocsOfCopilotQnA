### question
Is there a keyboard shortcut for VS Code that I can configure for my Vue projects to use when formatting the code or an auto format after save?

### answer
Yes, you can configure Visual Studio Code to format your code with a keyboard shortcut and enable auto-format on save for your Vue projects. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Configuring a Keyboard Shortcut for Formatting
1. Open Keyboard Shortcuts:

- Press Ctrl + K and then Ctrl + S to open the Keyboard Shortcuts editor.

2. Search for the Format Document Command:

- In the search bar at the top, type Format Document.

3. Assign a Keyboard Shortcut:

- Click on the entry for Format Document to select it.

- Click on the pencil icon that appears when you hover over the entry.

- Press the keys you want to use as your shortcut (e.g., Ctrl + Alt + F).

### Enabling Auto-Format on Save
1. Open Settings:

- Press Ctrl + , (or Cmd + , on macOS) to open the Settings.

2. Search for Format On Save:

- Type format on save in the search bar.

3. Enable Format On Save:

- Check the box next to Editor: Format On Save.

### Configuration in settings.json
You can also manually add the settings to your settings.json file for your project. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Open the Command Palette:

- Press Ctrl + Shift + P (or Cmd + Shift + P on macOS).

2. Open Settings (JSON):

- Type Preferences: Open Settings (JSON) and select it.

3. Add the Following Configuration:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "eslint.validate": ["javascript", "javascriptreact", "vue"]
}
```

This will ensure that your code is automatically formatted when you save the file, and you can also trigger formatting manually with your assigned keyboard shortcut.

### Summary
* Keyboard Shortcut: Configure a keyboard shortcut for Format Document (e.g., Ctrl + Alt + F).

* Auto-Format on Save: Enable auto-format on save in your settings.

* Configuration File: Add the necessary settings to your settings.json.

This setup will help keep your code neatly formatted and consistent across your Vue projects. Let me know if you need further assistance or if there's anything else you'd like to explore! ðŸ˜Š
