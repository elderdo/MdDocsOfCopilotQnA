I know the VS 2022 shows a MAUI GUI when running with the debugger. Does VS 2022 provide a GUI when trying to build it with the XAML code? Are there any extensions which can also help do the GUI design?

Yes, Visual Studio 2022 does provide a GUI when building .NET MAUI apps with XAML code⁶. You can design a UI for a .NET MAUI app using XAML⁸. The .NET MAUI extension for Visual Studio Code includes features like XAML IntelliSense and Hot Reload, which can significantly aid in GUI design⁷.

As for extensions that can help with GUI design, there are several available. Here are a few:

1. **.NET MAUI Extension for Visual Studio Code**: This extension brings the tools you need to develop .NET MAUI apps into the lightweight Visual Studio Code experience. It includes XAML IntelliSense and Hot Reload⁷.

2. **Claudia IDE**: This extension allows you to apply a custom background image to the Visual Studio text editor, providing some useful customizations to the Visual Studio editor's background².

3. **FileIcons**: This extension installs and registers icons for various file types. When the extension encounters a file type it knows about, the appropriate icon will automatically be displayed².

Remember to check the Visual Studio Marketplace for more extensions that can enhance your GUI design experience in Visual Studio 2022¹⁴⁵.
