### question

When should Mongodb or another NOSql database be used?

### answer

**When to Use MongoDB or Other NoSQL Databases**

NoSQL databases like MongoDB are ideal in several scenarios:

1. **Document-Centric Data**: When your data is document-centric and doesn't fit well into the schema of a relational database⁶.
2. **Massive Scale**: When you need to accommodate massive scale and handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data⁷.
3. **Rapid Prototyping**: When you are rapidly prototyping and need a flexible schema⁶.
4. **High Performance**: When high performance in reads and writes is required, especially for caching and session management⁵.
5. **Horizontal Scaling**: When you need to scale out by distributing data across multiple machines⁷.
6. **Flexible Schemas**: When you need flexible schemas that can evolve with your application⁵.

These databases are particularly useful for applications that require real-time analytics, content management, and IoT data storage⁴.
