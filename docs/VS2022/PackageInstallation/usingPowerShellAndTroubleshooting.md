### question

In VS 2022 Enterprise editon when I open a Powershell Terminal and use the Install-Package command the command is not able to access the Artifactory repositories even though I have a config file setup for it. When installing from the browser it may be working or it may be getting packages via the internet. How can I fix the Powsershell Terminal so that is works with our installation of artifatory? Additionally, how can I troubleshoot VS 2022 and see if it is using the config file and artifactory or it is getting packages via the internet?

### answer

To fix the issue with the PowerShell Terminal in VS 2022 Enterprise Edition not accessing the Artifactory repositories, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check the Configuration File**:

   - Ensure that your `NuGet.Config` file is correctly set up with the Artifactory repository details. The file should be located in one of the following paths:
     - `%AppData%\NuGet\NuGet.Config`
     - `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\NuGet\Config\NuGet.Config`
     - A custom path specified in your environment variables.

2. **Verify the Repository URL**:

   - Make sure the repository URL in the `NuGet.Config` file is correct and accessible. You can test the URL in a browser to ensure it is reachable.

3. **Set the Repository Source**:

   - Use the `Register-PSRepository` command to register the Artifactory repository in PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     Register-PSRepository -Name "Artifactory" -SourceLocation "https://your-artifactory-url/api/nuget/v3/your-repo-name" -InstallationPolicy Trusted
     ```

4. **Install the Package**:
   - Use the `Install-Package` command with the `-Source` parameter to specify the Artifactory repository:
     ```powershell
     Install-Package -Name "PackageName" -Source "Artifactory"
     ```

To troubleshoot if VS 2022 is using the config file and Artifactory or getting packages via the internet, you can:

1. **Check the Logs**:

   - Review the logs in Visual Studio to see if there are any errors or warnings related to package installation. You can find the logs in the Output window under "Package Manager".

2. **Network Traffic Monitoring**:

   - Use a network monitoring tool like Fiddler or Wireshark to capture the network traffic when installing packages. This will help you see if the requests are going to Artifactory or another source.

3. **Test with Command Line**:

   - Try installing the package using the `nuget.exe` CLI tool with the `-Source` parameter to specify the Artifactory repository. This can help you determine if the issue is specific to Visual Studio or a broader configuration problem:
     ```powershell
     nuget install PackageName -Source "https://your-artifactory-url/api/nuget/v3/your-repo-name"
     ```

4. **Review Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the `NuGet.Config` file is correctly referenced in Visual Studio. You can check this in the NuGet Package Manager settings.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and ensure that your PowerShell Terminal in VS 2022 works with your Artifactory installation. If you encounter any specific errors, feel free to share them, and I can help you troubleshoot further.
