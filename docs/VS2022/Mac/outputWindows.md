### question
On a Mac using Visual Studio where is the output displayed for System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine? On a mac I don't see an output window when executing.  Just the terminal window displays.  How do I open an output window?

### answer
To open the Output window in Visual Studio for Mac, follow these steps:

1. **Go to the menu bar** and select **View**.
2. From the dropdown, select **Output**.

If you still don't see the Output window, make sure that the "Show output from" dropdown in the Output window is set to "Debug"⁴.
