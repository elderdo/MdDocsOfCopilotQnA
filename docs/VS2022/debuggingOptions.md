### question

For VS 2022 Enterprise edition I don't see a checkbox for Managed, Native, Script when selecting menu Tools > Options > Debugging > Just-In-Time. Where would those options appear for VS 2022 Enterprise Edition version 11.17.2?

### answer

In Visual Studio 2022 Enterprise Edition version 11.17.2, the Just-In-Time debugging options for Managed, Native, and Script code should still be available. If you don't see them, it might be due to a different configuration or a missing component. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Check for Updates**: Ensure that your Visual Studio is up to date. Sometimes, missing options can be due to outdated versions.
2. **Modify Installation**: Go to the Visual Studio Installer and modify your installation to ensure that all necessary components for debugging are installed.
3. **Reset Settings**: Try resetting your Visual Studio settings to default. Go to `Tools > Import and Export Settings > Reset all settings`.
4. **Reinstall Visual Studio**: As a last resort, you might consider reinstalling Visual Studio to ensure all components are correctly installed.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, you might want to consult the [Visual Studio documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/debug-using-the-just-in-time-debugger?view=vs-2022) or reach out to Microsoft support for further assistance.
