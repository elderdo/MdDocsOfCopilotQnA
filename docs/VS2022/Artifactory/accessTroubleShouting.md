### question

One browser MS Edge can access a url that is in my NuGet.config file, but Firefox cannot. What credentials would VS 2022 use: MS Edge credentials, Firefox credential, or its own credentials? How can I see how each browser and VS 2022 are trying to access the artifactory repository url?

### answer

Visual Studio 2022 uses its own credentials for accessing the Artifactory repository, independent of the credentials used by browsers like MS Edge or Firefox. Hereâ€™s how you can check how each browser and VS 2022 are trying to access the Artifactory repository URL:

### Checking Browser Access:

1. **MS Edge**:

   - Open Developer Tools (F12) and go to the **Network** tab.
   - Access the Artifactory URL and observe the network requests to see the headers and credentials being used.

2. **Firefox**:
   - Open Developer Tools (F12) and go to the **Network** tab.
   - Access the Artifactory URL and observe the network requests to see the headers and credentials being used.

### Checking Visual Studio 2022 Access:

1. **NuGet.Config File**:

   - Ensure that the `NuGet.Config` file contains the correct credentials for the Artifactory repository. The credentials can be stored in plain text or encrypted format.
   - Example entry in `NuGet.Config`:
     ```xml
     <packageSourceCredentials>
       <Artifactory>
         <add key="Username" value="your-username" />
         <add key="ClearTextPassword" value="your-password" />
       </Artifactory>
     </packageSourceCredentials>
     ```

2. **Credential Providers**:

   - Visual Studio may use a credential provider to authenticate with the Artifactory repository. Ensure that the credential provider is correctly configured.
   - You can use the [Azure Artifacts Credential Provider](https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider) if you are using Azure Artifacts.

3. **Network Traffic Monitoring**:

   - Use a network monitoring tool like Fiddler or Wireshark to capture the network traffic when Visual Studio is accessing the Artifactory repository. This will help you see the requests and credentials being used.

4. **Visual Studio Output Window**:
   - Check the Output window in Visual Studio under "Package Manager" to see any logs related to package installation and authentication.

By following these steps, you can determine how each browser and Visual Studio 2022 are accessing the Artifactory repository URL and troubleshoot any credential-related issues. If you encounter any specific errors, feel free to share them, and I can help you troubleshoot further.
