### question

What if the Output and Error List windows are filling the entire area to the right of the Solution Explorer? I have tried docking at a lower location, however the area is not high lighted when I move the undocked window around.

### answer

If the Output and Error List windows are filling the entire area to the right of the Solution Explorer and you are unable to dock them, you can try resetting the window layout in Visual Studio 2022. Here are the steps:

1. **Reset Window Layout**:

   - Go to the `Window` menu.
   - Select `Reset Window Layout`.
   - Confirm the action by clicking `Yes`.

2. **Dock the Windows**:

   - After resetting, try docking the Output and Error List windows again.
   - Drag the window to the desired location until you see the docking guide indicators, then release the mouse button.

3. **Manual Docking**:

   - If the above steps don't work, you can manually dock the windows by dragging them to the edges of the Visual Studio window until you see the docking guides.

4. **Check for Updates**:
   - Ensure that your Visual Studio 2022 is up to date. Sometimes, updates can fix UI-related issues.

If the issue persists, you might want to check the [Visual Studio documentation](4) or [Microsoft Q&A](5) for more detailed troubleshooting steps.
