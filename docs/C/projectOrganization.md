### question
In VS 2022 Enterprise's C project when I right click on the project via Solution Explorer, I don't see Add > New Folder ... just Add > New Filter and it shows an icon similar to a folder.  Do I select Filter or is that something special for another feature?

### answer
In Visual Studio 2022 for C/C++ projects, the Add > New Filter option is indeed what you use to organize your files within the project. Unlike a traditional folder in other project types, a filter is a virtual structure that helps you group files in Solution Explorer without affecting the actual file system.

### Here’s what you need to know:

- Filters organize files only within Visual Studio (they don't create actual folders on your disk).
- The Filter acts like a folder in the Solution Explorer, allowing you to group files for easier navigation and management.
- To manage files in the file system (such as creating actual folders), you would do that outside of Visual Studio in your file explorer, and then add files to your project via Add > Existing Item.

So if you want to organize your files within the project view, you can use New Filter. If you need real file system folders, you’ll have to create those manually outside of Visual Studio and then link the files into your project.

### question
For compatibility with other apps like VS Code or gcc should I just define real folders to organize libraries of C code and other C files?  What is the best structure to use in order to work with various build systems such as make, maven, or other build options and still work within VS 2022 Enterprise for a robust C project?

### answer
Yes, for better compatibility with other tools like VS Code, gcc, and various build systems like make or cmake, it's recommended to use real folders in the file system rather than relying solely on Visual Studio's virtual filters. This ensures that your project structure remains consistent across different environments and tools. Here's how you can structure your C project to ensure robustness and flexibility when using various build systems and IDEs:

Recommended Project Structure
```rust
/ProjectRoot
    /src        -> All source (.c) files
    /include    -> All header (.h) files
    /lib        -> Any third-party or static libraries
    /build      -> Generated build artifacts (object files, binaries, etc.)
    /tests      -> Unit tests or test scripts
    /docs       -> Documentation for the project
    /scripts    -> Utility scripts for building, running, or debugging
    Makefile    -> For `make` builds
    CMakeLists.txt -> For CMake builds
    README.md   -> Project documentation
```

### Benefits of this Structure:
1. Compatibility Across Tools: Tools like gcc, make, cmake, and IDEs like VS Code work naturally with this kind of structure because real folders map directly to filesystem paths.

2. Separation of Concerns: The separation of source (src), headers (include), libraries (lib), and build outputs (build) makes it easier to manage large projects and collaborate with teams.

3. Cross-Platform Flexibility: A structure like this works well across different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) and build systems.

4. Version Control: Using real folders simplifies working with version control systems (e.g., Git), as the entire project structure, including files, remains visible and consistent.

### Using This Structure in Visual Studio 2022
1. Creating Real Folders: You can create real folders in the file system using File Explorer (or terminal) and then add those files into your project in Visual Studio.

- Right-click the project in Solution Explorer.
- Select Add > Existing Item.
- Navigate to the real folders and add the files.
2. VS Configuration: Visual Studio allows you to integrate with external build systems like CMake. You can create or import a CMakeLists.txt file to use cmake as your build system within Visual Studio. If you're using make, you can also configure external tools to work with Visual Studio for running builds.

Build Systems to Consider:
- Makefiles: Ideal for smaller projects or those already using gcc and Unix-like tools. You can include a Makefile that defines how to compile and link your project.

- CMake: Highly recommended for cross-platform projects. CMake generates platform-specific build files (e.g., Visual Studio solutions, Unix makefiles) and is compatible with various IDEs and compilers. Visual Studio natively supports CMake projects (File > Open > CMake).

- Maven or Gradle: Typically used for Java, but can manage C/C++ projects via plugins like ninja or cmake. However, for pure C projects, CMake or make are more commonly used.

### Conclusion
For a robust C project structure that works seamlessly across various build systems and IDEs (including Visual Studio 2022, VS Code, gcc, make, and cmake), it's best to organize your code into real folders (e.g., src, include, lib, etc.). You can use Visual Studio's flexibility to handle both standard and external build systems, giving you the best of both worlds.
