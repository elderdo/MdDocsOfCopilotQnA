### question
For a VS 2022 static C library project and related test project,  how would I be able to rename and have it work well for the current solution?

### answer
Yes, it would be a good idea to rename your library to conform to C naming conventions. Following the best practices for naming C static libraries, you should use a lowercase name prefixed with lib. For example, you could rename XmlParserLib to libxmlparser.a.

Here are the steps to rename your static library and ensure it works well in your Visual Studio 2022 solution:

1.	Rename the Library Project:
•	In Visual Studio, right-click on your library project in the Solution Explorer and select "Rename".
•	Change the project name to libxmlparser.
2.	Update the Output Name:
•	Right-click on the renamed project and select "Properties".
•	Go to "Configuration Properties" -> "General".
•	Change the "Target Name" to libxmlparser.
•	Ensure the "Configuration Type" is set to "Static Library (.lib)".
3.	Update References in Your Code:
•	Update any references to the old library name in your code and project files.
•	For example, if you have #pragma comment(lib, "XmlParserLib"), change it to #pragma comment(lib, "libxmlparser").
4.	Update the Test Project:
•	If you have a test project that references the static library, update the references there as well.
•	Right-click on the test project, go to "Properties", and update the "Additional Dependencies" under "Configuration Properties" -> "Linker" -> "Input" to include libxmlparser.lib.
5.	Rebuild the Solution:
•	Rebuild your entire solution to ensure that all references are updated and the new library name is correctly linked.

By following these steps, you will have renamed your static library to conform to C naming conventions and ensured that it works well within your Visual Studio 2022 solution.
