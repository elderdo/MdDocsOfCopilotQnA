### question
For the acronym SOLID, can you give me a short concise definition for the it and short examples of how C# apply to each of the 5 principles?

### answer
Absolutely, let's break down SOLID principles in a concise manner and see how each can be applied in C#:

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**Definition:** A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.
**Example in C#:**
```csharp
public class Invoice {
    public void CalculateTotal() { /* calculation logic */ }
}

public class InvoicePrinter {
    public void Print(Invoice invoice) { /* printing logic */ }
}
```
*Invoice* handles calculations, while *InvoicePrinter* handles printing, ensuring each class has a single responsibility.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**Definition:** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
**Example in C#:**
```csharp
public abstract class Shape {
    public abstract double Area();
}

public class Rectangle : Shape {
    public double Width { get; set; }
    public double Height { get; set; }
    public override double Area() => Width * Height;
}

public class Circle : Shape {
    public double Radius { get; set; }
    public override double Area() => Math.PI * Radius * Radius;
}
```
Adding new shapes doesn't require modifying existing `Shape` classes, adhering to OCP.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**Definition:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
**Example in C#:**
```csharp
public class Bird {
    public virtual void Fly() { /* flying logic */ }
}

public class Sparrow : Bird { }

public class Ostrich : Bird {
    public override void Fly() {
        throw new NotImplementedException(); // Ostrich can't fly
    }
}
```
Inappropriate application of LSP, since `Ostrich` should not inherit `Fly()`.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**Definition:** Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
**Example in C#:**
```csharp
public interface IWorker {
    void Work();
    void Eat();
}

public interface IWorkable {
    void Work();
}

public interface IFeedable {
    void Eat();
}

public class Worker : IWorkable, IFeedable {
    public void Work() { /* working logic */ }
    public void Eat() { /* eating logic */ }
}
```
Interfaces `IWorkable` and `IFeedable` are split to ensure that classes only implement what they need.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**Definition:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
**Example in C#:**
```csharp
public interface INotification {
    void Send(string message);
}

public class EmailNotification : INotification {
    public void Send(string message) { /* send email */ }
}

public class SMSNotification : INotification {
    public void Send(string message) { /* send SMS */ }
}

public class NotificationService {
    private readonly INotification _notification;

    public NotificationService(INotification notification) {
        _notification = notification;
    }

    public void Notify(string message) {
        _notification.Send(message);
    }
}
```
`NotificationService` depends on the abstraction `INotification`, not concrete implementations.

By applying these principles, you can make your C# code more modular, maintainable, and adaptable to change. Let me know if you need more detailed examples or explanations! ðŸš€ðŸ˜Š
