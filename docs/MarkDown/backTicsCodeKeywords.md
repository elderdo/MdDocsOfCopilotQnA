### question

When Mark Down requires code it uses the three back tics followed by the type of code it contains and ends with three more back tics on a separate line. Can you a list of names that can be used after the first three back tics to designate the type of code being entered?

### answer

Here are some common language identifiers you can use after the three backticks to specify the type of code in Markdown:

- `bash` or `sh` for Shell scripts
- `c` for C
- `cpp` for C++
- `cs` for C#
- `css` for CSS
- `dart` for Dart
- `go` for Go
- `html` for HTML
- `java` for Java
- `js` or `javascript` for JavaScript
- `json` for JSON
- `kt` for Kotlin
- `lua` for Lua
- `md` or `markdown` for Markdown
- `php` for PHP
- `py` or `python` for Python
- `r` for R
- `rb` or `ruby` for Ruby
- `rs` for Rust
- `sql` for SQL
- `swift` for Swift
- `ts` or `typescript` for TypeScript
- `xml` for XML
- `yaml` or `yml` for YAML

These identifiers help enable syntax highlighting for the respective languages in Markdown¹²³.
