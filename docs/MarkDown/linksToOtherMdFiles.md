### question

In mark down how do you create a hyper link to an another mark down file?

### answer

To create a hyperlink to another markdown file in Markdown, you can use the following syntax:

```markdown
[Link Text](path/to/your/file.md)
```

For example, if you have a file named `example.md` in the same directory, you would write:

```markdown
[Example File](example.md)
```
