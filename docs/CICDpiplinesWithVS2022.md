Yes, Visual Studio 2022 solutions can be hooked up to a CI/CD pipeline. Here are some methods to do so:

1. **Azure DevOps Starter Project**: The Azure DevOps Starter project can automatically configure a full CI/CD pipeline in your Azure DevOps organization⁴.

2. **Continuous Delivery Tools for Visual Studio**: This extension allows you to configure Continuous Delivery to Azure App Services, Web Containers, and Service Fabric Clusters for ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core projects³.

3. **MSBuild Task**: You can use an MSBuild task and switch from Version to Specify Location and insert the path to the msbuild.exe of VS2022².

4. **Command Line Task**: You can use a Command line task and call the executable directly².

Remember, after setting up the CI/CD pipeline, you may need to customize it according to your project's needs¹. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
