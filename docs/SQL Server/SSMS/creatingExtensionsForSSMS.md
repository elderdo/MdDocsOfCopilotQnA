### Question
So, the t-sql formatter only integrates with vs 2022 ... not ssms. Can extensions be created for ssms via a vs 2022 app? If yes are there any good examples on github?

### Answer
Yes, you can create extensions for SSMS using Visual Studio 2022! SSMS extensions are created using the Visual Studio Software Development Kit (SDK). Here's a high-level overview of how you can create an SSMS extension using Visual Studio 2022:

### Steps to Create an SSMS Extension

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   - Install Visual Studio 2022.
   - Install the Visual Studio SDK.

2. **Create a VSIX Project**:
   - Open Visual Studio 2022.
   - Create a new project and select `VSIX Project` from the templates.

3. **Develop Your Extension**:
   - Implement the functionality you want in your extension.
   - Use the `DTE2` (Development Tools Environment) object to interact with SSMS.

4. **Package Your Extension**:
   - Build your project to create a `.vsix` file.
   - Distribute the `.vsix` file to users, who can install it manually.

### Example on GitHub

You can find examples and tutorials on GitHub that demonstrate how to create SSMS extensions. Here are a couple of useful resources:

- **[Create a SQL Server Management Studio Extension - CodeProject](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5306973/Create-a-SQL-Server-Management-Studio-Extension)**: This tutorial walks you through creating a simple SSMS extension.
- **[Install extensions in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/sql-docs/blob/live/docs/ssms/install-extensions-in-sql-server-management-studio-ssms.md)**: Official Microsoft documentation on installing and creating SSMS extensions.
