### Question
Does the SSMS editor provide text formatting?

### Answer
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) has some basic text formatting capabilities, but it is not as advanced as a dedicated code editor like Visual Studio Code. Here are some of the text formatting features available in SSMS:

### **Basic Text Formatting Features**
1. **Indentation**:
   - You can indent and outdent lines of text using `Tab` and `Shift + Tab`.

2. **Code Folding**:
   - SSMS supports code folding, allowing you to collapse and expand blocks of code (e.g., BEGIN...END, IF...ELSE).

3. **Syntax Highlighting**:
   - SSMS provides syntax highlighting, which colors the text based on SQL keywords, comments, strings, and operators for better readability.

4. **Customizable Fonts and Colors**:
   - You can customize the fonts and colors used in the editor by going to `Tools` > `Options` > `Fonts and Colors`.

5. **Brace Matching**:
   - SSMS automatically highlights matching braces (e.g., (), {}, []).

6. **Line Numbers**:
   - You can enable line numbers by going to `Tools` > `Options` > `Text Editor` > `Transact-SQL` > `General` and checking `Line numbers`.

7. **Uppercase/Lowercase Conversion**:
   - Convert selected text to uppercase or lowercase using `Ctrl + Shift + U` and `Ctrl + Shift + L`.

### **Add-ins for Enhanced Functionality**
For more advanced text formatting features, you might consider using add-ins such as:

- **SSMSBoost**: An add-in that offers additional text formatting, refactoring, and productivity features.
- **Redgate SQL Prompt**: Provides advanced code formatting, IntelliSense, and code completion features.

### **Quick Formatting Example**

If you want to quickly format a block of SQL code in SSMS, you can use the following steps:
1. **Select the text you want to format.**
2. **Right-click and select `Format SQL`**. (This option is available if you have an add-in like SQL Prompt installed.)

Here's a simple example of what formatted SQL code might look like:

**Before Formatting**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID=1;
```

**After Formatting**:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Employees
WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
```

These formatting features and tools can help make your code more readable and maintainable. Is there anything specific you would like to do with text formatting in SSMS? ðŸ˜Šâœ¨ðŸ“Š
