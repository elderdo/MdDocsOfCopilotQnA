### Question
What SQL Server tool would you use for the following requirement: "Ensure all scheduled jobs such as backups, ETL loads, and other items, have been executed correctly."?

### Answer
To ensure all scheduled jobs such as backups, ETL loads, and other items have been executed correctly in SQL Server, you would use **SQL Server Agent** along with the **Job Activity Monitor**.

### **SQL Server Agent**
SQL Server Agent is a Microsoft Windows service that executes scheduled administrative tasks, such as backups, database maintenance, and running SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) packages. It allows you to create and manage jobs, schedules, alerts, and operators.

### **Job Activity Monitor**
The Job Activity Monitor is a feature within SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) that allows you to monitor the current activity of all defined jobs on an instance of SQL Server. You can view the status of jobs, start and stop jobs, view job properties, and see the history for a specific job. This tool helps you ensure that all scheduled jobs have been executed correctly and allows you to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
