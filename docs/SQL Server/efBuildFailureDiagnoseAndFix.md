### question
When I used connection string "Server=DESKTOP-V79VNM2\\SQLEXPRESS03;Database=Tangy;Trusted_Connection=True;"
and the following classes:
```csharp
namespace Tangy_DataAccess.Data;
public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
{
    public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions<ApplicationDbContext> options) : base(options)
    {
        
    }

    public DbSet<Category> Categories { get; set; }
}

namespace Tangy_DataAccess.Data;
public class Category
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public DateTime CreatedDate { get; set; }
}
```
 when I run  the add-migration AddCategoryToDatabase, I get a Build failed error.  How do I find the cause of the failure and fix it?

### answer
Certainly! When encountering a "Build failed" error while running `add-migration` in Entity Framework Core, there are several steps you can take to diagnose and resolve the issue:

1. **Check for Compilation Errors**:
   - Examine the error message in the Package Manager Console (PMC) after running `add-migration`. Look for any compilation errors or warnings.
   - Open the Output window in Visual Studio to view detailed build logs (View > Output > Build). This can provide insights into the root cause of the failure¹.

2. **Verify Project Builds**:
   - Ensure that all projects in your solution can be successfully built. Sometimes the issue lies not with your main project but with another project in the solution that may be broken.
   - Go through each project and verify that it compiles without errors. If you find a project that fails to build, investigate and fix any issues⁵.

3. **Clean and Rebuild Solution**:
   - Perform a clean build of the entire solution to ensure that all projects are successfully compiled.
   - Use the command-line `dotnet build` or rebuild the solution within Visual Studio (Build > Rebuild Solution)¹.

4. **Check DbContext Implementation**:
   - Ensure that your `ApplicationDbContext` class correctly inherits from `DbContext`.
   - Verify that the connection string is correctly set in your `DbContext` constructor.
   - Make sure the `DbSet<Category>` property is properly defined in your `ApplicationDbContext` class³.

5. **Default Project and Startup Project**:
   - Confirm that the Default project in PMC is set to the correct one (usually your data access project containing the `DbContext`).
   - Check the startup project in Visual Studio's Solution Explorer to ensure it's the right one for your database operations.

6. **SonarQube or Other External Dependencies**:
   - If you're using SonarQube or other external tools, ensure that their dependencies are correctly configured. Sometimes missing dependencies can cause build failures².

Remember to follow these steps systematically, and you'll likely identify the cause of the build failure and be able to fix it. Good luck! 🚀

Found: Compilation Error - fixed, but had to add Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design to the startup project and made the builder options: 
```csharp
builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(
        builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection"), 
        b => b.MigrationsAssembly("TangyWeb_Server")));   
```
