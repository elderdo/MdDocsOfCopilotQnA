### question
Accoreding to MSSMS my server name is DESKTOP-V79VNM2\SQLEXPRESS03
What would a connection string for a sql server database named Tangy look like for my PC with the previous server name?

### answer
Certainly! To create a connection string for your SQL Server database named "Tangy" with the server name "DESKTOP-V79VNM2\SQLEXPRESS03," you can use the following format:

```
Server=DESKTOP-V79VNM2\SQLEXPRESS03;Database=Tangy;User Id=YourUsername;Password=YourPassword;
```

Replace `"YourUsername"` and `"YourPassword"` with your actual database credentials. This connection string specifies the server, database, and authentication details needed to connect to your SQL Server instanceÂ¹. ðŸš€
