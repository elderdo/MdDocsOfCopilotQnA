### Question
What are some of T-SQL's best features and can you give examples of each? Are there tools and/or features available for unit testing, optimizing, and bulk processing for SQL Server - i.e. some commonly used utilities to help with various tasks?

### Answer
Sure! Here are some of the best features of T-SQL (Transact-SQL) along with examples:

### T-SQL Features
1. **Variables**: Store temporary values.
   ```sql
   DECLARE @EmployeeID INT = 123;
   SELECT @EmployeeID;
   ```
2. **Conditional Execution**: Use `IF...ELSE` statements.
   ```sql
   IF @EmployeeID = 123
   BEGIN
       PRINT 'Employee found';
   END
   ELSE
   BEGIN
       PRINT 'Employee not found';
   END
   ```
3. **Stored Procedures**: Encapsulate SQL code for reuse.
   ```sql
   CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeDetails @EmployeeID INT
   AS
   BEGIN
       SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = @EmployeeID;
   END
   ```
4. **Triggers**: Automatically execute code in response to data modification.
   ```sql
   CREATE TRIGGER trgAfterInsert ON Employees
   AFTER INSERT
   AS
   BEGIN
       PRINT 'New employee added';
   END
   ```
5. **Functions**: Perform calculations and return values.
   ```sql
   CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeeCount()
   RETURNS INT
   AS
   BEGIN
       RETURN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees);
   END
   ```
6. **Views**: Create virtual tables.
   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW vwEmployeeDetails AS
   SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName FROM Employees;
   ```
7. **Transactions**: Ensure data integrity.
   ```sql
   BEGIN TRANSACTION;
   UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary * 1.1 WHERE EmployeeID = 123;
   COMMIT TRANSACTION;
   ```
8. **Joins**: Combine data from multiple tables.
   ```sql
   SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, d.DepartmentName
   FROM Employees e
   JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID;
   ```

### Tools for Unit Testing, Optimizing, and Bulk Processing
1. **SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)**: For unit testing.
   - Create and run SQL Server unit tests to verify the behavior of database objects.
2. **SQL Server Profiler**: For performance optimization.
   - Monitor and analyze SQL Server events to identify performance issues.
3. **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**: For bulk processing.
   - Use the Import and Export Wizard to import/export data in bulk.
4. **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)**: For complex data integration and transformation tasks.
   - Create ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) packages for bulk data processing.
5. **Database Engine Tuning Advisor**: For query optimization.
   - Analyze and recommend indexes and other optimizations to improve query performance.
