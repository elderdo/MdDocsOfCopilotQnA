### question

What are packages.config used for with C# .NET Xamarin / Android applications?

### answer

The `packages.config` file is used in some project types to maintain the list of NuGet packages referenced by the project. This allows NuGet to easily restore the project's dependencies when the project is transported to a different machine, such as a build server³.

In the context of C# .NET Xamarin/Android applications, `packages.config` helps manage the dependencies required for the application to run. However, it's worth noting that with the transition to .NET 6 and beyond, the recommended approach is to use `<PackageReference>` in the project file instead of `packages.config`¹².

Would you like to know more about migrating from `packages.config` to `<PackageReference>`?
