### question
does the sudo apt require admin privileges?  if not, are any other special privileges required?

### answer
Yes, `sudo` does require administrative (root) privileges to execute commands. In the context of `sudo apt install`, the `sudo` command is used to grant temporary root privileges to the user so they can perform tasks that require access to system files or administrative rights, such as installing packages.

### Key Points:
- **`sudo`**: By default, `sudo` allows users to run commands with the security privileges of another user (usually the superuser or root).
- **Admin privileges**: To use `sudo`, the user needs to be part of the **sudoers** group, which is typically set up during the initial installation of the Linux system.
  
### Without `sudo`:
- If you don't have `sudo` privileges, you wonâ€™t be able to run `apt install` or perform any task that requires administrative rights.
- Without these privileges, you are limited to installing software in user-space (e.g., compiling and installing programs in your home directory) but you won't be able to install system-wide software.

### Alternatives if you don't have `sudo`:
- **Contact the system administrator**: If you're using a system without root access, you can ask the admin to install the necessary software.
- **Package management in user space**: Some tools like **Homebrew** or **conda** allow users to manage packages in their local environments without requiring root privileges.

In summary, `sudo apt install` requires admin privileges, and the user must have access to the `sudo` command.
