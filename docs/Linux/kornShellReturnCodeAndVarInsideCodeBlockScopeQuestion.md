### question

When using a Linux Korn shell script and a function is invoked in a code block like this { main;rc=$? } how can the block of code return the value of rc which is the return code from the main function for the script so that the code that follows can respond to a non zero return code with the appropriate error message?

### answer

To handle the return code from a function in a Korn shell script and respond appropriately, you can use the following approach:

1. **Invoke the function and capture its return code**:

   ```ksh
   {
       main
       rc=$?
   }
   ```

2. **Check the return code and respond accordingly**:
   ```ksh
   if [ $rc -ne 0 ]; then
       echo "Error: main function failed with return code $rc"
       # Handle the error as needed
   else
       echo "Success: main function completed successfully"
       # Continue with the rest of the script
   fi
   ```

Here's a complete example:

```ksh
#!/bin/ksh

main() {
    # Your function logic here
    return 1  # Simulate an error for demonstration
}

{
    main
    rc=$?
}

if [ $rc -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error: main function failed with return code $rc"
    # Handle the error as needed
else
    echo "Success: main function completed successfully"
    # Continue with the rest of the script
fi
```

In this script:

- The `main` function is called within a code block.
- The return code of the `main` function is captured in the variable `rc`.
- An `if` statement checks the value of `rc`. If it's non-zero, an error message is printed, and you can add any additional error handling logic as needed. If `rc` is zero, a success message is printed, and the script continues.

This approach ensures that you can handle different return codes from your function and respond appropriately in your script. Let me know if you need further assistance or have any other questions!

### question

I think I see the problem, the main does output messages but both stdout and stderr get piped to tee so I believe that is why the return code from the block is not getting to outside the block. Is it correct to say that the rc assigned within the block is local to the block and outside the block rc has not been set. Is that the problem and if it is how can it be fixed?

### answer

You're correct that the return code (`rc`) assigned within the block is local to that block. When you pipe the output to `tee`, it can indeed interfere with capturing the return code correctly. To fix this, you can capture the return code before piping the output to `tee`.

Here's how you can modify your script to ensure the return code is captured correctly:

1. **Invoke the function and capture its return code** before piping the output:

   ```ksh
   {
       main
       rc=$?
   } 2>&1 | tee output.log
   ```

2. **Check the return code and respond accordingly**:
   ```ksh
   if [ $rc -ne 0 ]; then
       echo "Error: main function failed with return code $rc"
       # Handle the error as needed
   else
       echo "Success: main function completed successfully"
       # Continue with the rest of the script
   fi
   ```

Here's a complete example:

```ksh
#!/bin/ksh

main() {
    # Your function logic here
    echo "This is a message from main"
    return 1  # Simulate an error for demonstration
}

{
    main
    rc=$?
} 2>&1 | tee output.log

if [ $rc -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error: main function failed with return code $rc"
    # Handle the error as needed
else
    echo "Success: main function completed successfully"
    # Continue with the rest of the script
fi
```

In this script:

- The `main` function is called within a code block, and its return code is captured in the variable `rc` before the output is piped to `tee`.
- The `2>&1` part ensures that both `stdout` and `stderr` are captured and piped to `tee`.
- The `if` statement checks the value of `rc`. If it's non-zero, an error message is printed, and you can add any additional error handling logic as needed. If `rc` is zero, a success message is printed, and the script continues.

This approach ensures that the return code is correctly captured and can be used outside the block. Let me know if this resolves your issue or if you need further assistance!

### question

That didn't work. If the rc is local to the block and doesn't seem to retain its value when set inside the block. I ran my script using ksh -x thescript.sh and saw that the rc was zero outside the block. What am I doing wrong or how do I indicate that rc is global to the entire script?

### answer

You're right that the return code (`rc`) set inside the block is local to that block. To ensure that `rc` retains its value outside the block, you can use a different approach to capture the return code globally.

One way to achieve this is by using a subshell to execute the block and capture the return code outside of it. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Invoke the function and capture its return code** in a subshell:

   ```ksh
   (
       main
       rc=$?
       exit $rc
   )
   rc=$?
   ```

2. **Check the return code and respond accordingly**:
   ```ksh
   if [ $rc -ne 0 ]; then
       echo "Error: main function failed with return code $rc"
       # Handle the error as needed
   else
       echo "Success: main function completed successfully"
       # Continue with the rest of the script
   fi
   ```

Here's a complete example:

```ksh
#!/bin/ksh

main() {
    # Your function logic here
    echo "This is a message from main"
    return 1  # Simulate an error for demonstration
}

(
    main
    rc=$?
    exit $rc
)
rc=$?

if [ $rc -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error: main function failed with return code $rc"
    # Handle the error as needed
else
    echo "Success: main function completed successfully"
    # Continue with the rest of the script
fi
```

In this script:

- The `main` function is called within a subshell, and its return code is captured in the variable `rc` inside the subshell.
- The `exit $rc` command ensures that the subshell exits with the same return code as the `main` function.
- The return code of the subshell is then captured in the variable `rc` outside the subshell.
- The `if` statement checks the value of `rc`. If it's non-zero, an error message is printed, and you can add any additional error handling logic as needed. If `rc` is zero, a success message is printed, and the script continues.

This approach ensures that the return code is correctly captured and can be used outside the block. Let me know if this resolves your issue or if you need further assistance!
