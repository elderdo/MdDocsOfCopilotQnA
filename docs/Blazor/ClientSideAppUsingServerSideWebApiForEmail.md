### Question: For a C# Blazor application that utilizes both client side and server side code how do you send emails via the client side code?  Can you show me an example or point me to a github example?



### Answer:
In a Blazor application, sending emails directly from the client-side is not typically possible due to browser security restrictions¹. This is not a limitation of Blazor or ASP.NET Core, but a general restriction in browsers that also applies to JavaScript¹.

However, there are a couple of workarounds:

1. **Server-side API**: You can create a server-side API that sends the email. Your Blazor client-side code can then call this API to send the email¹. This approach requires an SMTP server to send the email¹.

2. **Invoke User's Native Email Application**: Another approach is to invoke the user's native email application from your Blazor WebAssembly application¹. This won't send the email directly, but it will open the user's default email application with the "To", "Subject", and "Body" fields pre-filled.

Here is an example of how you can invoke the user's native email application:

```csharp
@page "/email"
@inject NavigationManager NavigationManager

<button @onclick="OpenEmailClient">Send Email</button>

@code {
    private void OpenEmailClient()
    {
        var email = "example@example.com";
        var subject = Uri.EscapeDataString("Hello");
        var body = Uri.EscapeDataString("This is the body of the email.");
        NavigationManager.NavigateTo($"mailto:{email}?subject={subject}&body={body}", forceLoad: true);
    }
}
```

In this code, when the button is clicked, the `OpenEmailClient` method is called. This method creates a `mailto:` URL with the desired email, subject, and body, and then uses the `NavigationManager` to navigate to this URL. This will open the user's default email client with the specified email, subject, and body.

Please note that these methods do not send the email directly from the client-side code, but they provide ways to send an email in a Blazor application.

For more detailed examples and code snippets, you can refer to the [dotnet/blazor-samples](^5^) repository on GitHub. Please note that while this repository contains many examples of Blazor code, it may not contain an example of this specific use case. However, it can be a valuable resource for learning more about how to perform various tasks in Blazor. 

Remember to always follow security best practices when implementing these solutions to prevent misuse¹. For example, if you're using a server-side API, you should implement measures such as rate limiting and sender whitelisting¹.
