### I've been testing gfortran from a Windows command prompt. The compiler changes the text color from its default settings and that color does not get changed back to the default. Is there a way to reset to the default settings without closing the command prompt and opening a new command prompt window?

Yes, you can reset the color of the Command Prompt without closing it. Here are the steps:

1. Open the Command Prompt.
2. Right-click on the title bar.
3. Select 'Defaults'.
4. Move to the 'Colors' tab².

This will allow you to adjust the colors back to your preferred settings. Once you've made your changes, they should apply to the current window as well as any future Command Prompt windows you open.

If you're looking for a command to reset the color within a script, you can use the `color` command with no arguments. This will reset the color to whatever is defined in the Command Prompt's properties.

Please note that these changes will not affect the colors used by gfortran or any other program that explicitly sets its own text colors. If gfortran is changing the text color, you would need to modify gfortran's settings or the script that's running gfortran to change this behavior. If you need further assistance with this, please let me know!

### I tried that. The default colors showed the correct values. It had no effect on the text color.

I see, it seems like the color change is not persisting as expected. This could be due to gfortran or another program changing the color settings. Here are a couple of additional methods you can try:

1. **Use the `color` command**: You can try resetting the color using the `color` command followed by the color code in the Command Prompt. For example, `color 07` will set the text color to light gray and the background to black³.

2. **Modify the Registry**: You can change the color settings via the Windows Registry. Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor` and check the `DefaultColor` entry. You can modify the value there to change the default color⁵.

3. **Use ANSI Escape Sequences**: If your Windows version is 10 or later, the Windows console supports ANSI Escape Sequences, which can be used to change the color of the text and background².

Please remember to be careful while making changes to the Windows Registry as incorrect changes can cause system instability. If you're not comfortable with this, I would recommend seeking assistance from someone who is familiar with the Windows Registry. If none of these methods work, it might be necessary to look into the settings or scripts for gfortran or any other command line programs you're using to see if they're changing the color settings. Let me know if you need further assistance!
