### Does Postgress support utilities like Oracle's [SQL*Plus](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14357/qstart.htm), [SQL*Loader](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sutil/oracle-sql-loader.html), and schema export [exp](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sutil/oracle-original-export-utility.html) and import [imp](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B13789_01/server.101/b10825/exp_imp.htm) tools like [Data Pump](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/sutil/oracle-data-pump-export-utility.html)?


Yes, PostgreSQL does provide similar utilities to Oracle's SQL*Plus, SQL*Loader, and Data Pump:

1. **SQL*Plus Equivalent**: PostgreSQL has a command-line client tool called `psql`¹. It is equivalent to Oracle's SQL*Plus and is used to connect to the database, run SQL code, generate reports, and diagnose application problems related to the database¹.

2. **SQL*Loader Equivalent**: PostgreSQL has a built-in utility called `COPY` that is similar to Oracle's SQL*Loader². For more advanced data loading needs, PostgreSQL also has an external utility called `pgloader`².

3. **Data Pump Equivalent**: PostgreSQL doesn't have a direct equivalent to Oracle's Data Pump. However, it does provide a utility called `pg_dump` for exporting a database schema⁴.

Please note that while these PostgreSQL utilities perform similar functions to their Oracle counterparts, there may be differences in usage and functionality. It's recommended to refer to the PostgreSQL documentation for detailed usage instructions.
