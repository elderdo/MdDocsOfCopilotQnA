Can C#'s Regex handle capture groups using parentheses and then \1 ...\n where \1 corresponds to the first capture group: the text matching the stirng between the first set of parentheses and \n is the nth set of parentheses? Can you show me an example?

Yes, C#'s `Regex` class can handle capture groups. You can define a capture group by enclosing the part of the pattern you want to capture in parentheses `( )`. In the replacement string, you can refer to these groups by number, using the syntax `$n`, where `n` is the number of the capture group.

Here's an example where we swap the first and last names in a string:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string input = "John Doe";
        string pattern = "(\\w+) (\\w+)";
        string replacement = "$2 $1";

        string result = Regex.Replace(input, pattern, replacement);

        Console.WriteLine(result);
        // Output: Doe John
    }
}
```

In this example, the pattern `(\\w+) (\\w+)` defines two capture groups separated by a space. The first group `(\\w+)` matches the first name and the second group matches the last name. In the replacement string, `$2 $1`, `$1` refers to the first capture group and `$2` refers to the second. So this code swaps the first and last names in the input string. This is similar to how you might use backreferences `\1`, `\2`, etc., in Perl or Python for referring to capture groups. Note that in C#, the backreference syntax is `$n` instead of `\n`.

Does C# have any way to define a Regex expression without having the escape before each regex meta-set that use the backslash? Something similar to how it allows Window's directory paths by preceding the first quote with @.

Yes, C# does provide a way to define a `Regex` expression without having to escape each regex meta-character that uses the backslash. You can use the `@` character at the start of the string to define a verbatim string literal, where the backslash `\` is not a special character and is treated like any other character.

Here's the previous example modified to use a verbatim string literal for the pattern:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Text.RegularExpressions;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string input = "John Doe";
        string pattern = @"(\w+) (\w+)";
        string replacement = "$2 $1";

        string result = Regex.Replace(input, pattern, replacement);

        Console.WriteLine(result);
        // Output: Doe John
    }
}
```

In this example, the pattern `@"(\w+) (\w+)"` is a verbatim string literal, so the backslashes are not escape characters and you don't need to double them. This makes the regex pattern easier to read and write. The `@` character tells C# to interpret the string literally - that is, to ignore escape characters and line breaks. This is similar to how you might use raw strings in Python or Perl. Note that in the replacement string, you still use the `$n` syntax to refer to capture groups. The `@` character does not change this syntax.
