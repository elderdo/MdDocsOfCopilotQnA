# Is there an open source "cross reference" tool? I want to find a tool that can create a cross reference for a computer language like PL/SQL, which is basically a subset of the ADA Programming language. So, a tool that could cross reference the ADA Programming language may come close. I have searched for one, but I'm unable to find one. Has C# been used to create any cross reference tools like that - even simple ones would be helpful? In other words a simple C# app that reads words and creates some nice hyperlinked text that is in an easy order or that can be easily reordered in any sequence or hierarchical structure.

For **PL/SQL**, you might find the following tools useful:

- **TOra**: An open-source SQL IDE for Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL databases².
- **DBeaver**: A free and open-source alternative to PL/SQL Developer³.

For **ADA Programming language**, here are some resources:

- **Awesome-Ada**: A curated list of awesome resources related to the Ada and SPARK programming language⁴.
- **Ada Forge**: Open Source Ada Code and Tools for programming in Ada language⁵.

In terms of **C#**, there are a few options:

- **ReSharper and CodeRush/RefactorPro**: These tools integrate with Visual Studio and provide better visibility for finding usages and references⁸.
- **CSharpRepl**: A command-line C# REPL with syntax highlighting, which can be used for cross-referencing[^10^].
- **Total.NET XRef**: This tool is integrated into the Visual Studio.NET environment and can generate cross-references¹¹.

These tools should help you create cross-references for PL/SQL, ADA, and C# code. They can read words and create hyperlinked text that can be easily reordered in any sequence or hierarchical structure. However, please note that the effectiveness of these tools can vary based on the complexity of the codebase and the specific requirements of your project.
