Are there any tools that can help convert a Xamarin app to a Maui app?

Yes, there are tools and methods available to help convert a Xamarin app to a .NET MAUI app:

1. **.NET Upgrade Assistant**: This tool helps upgrade Xamarin.Forms projects to .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) by converting the solution's project file and performing common code updates⁴. It's available as a Visual Studio extension on Windows, and as a CLI tool for Windows and Mac⁴.

2. **Manual Migration**: You can manually create a new .NET MAUI project and copy your code and resources from the Xamarin app to the .NET MAUI app⁶.

3. **Hybrid Approach**: Some developers prefer to use a combined approach where they first utilize the upgrade assistant tool to convert the project and then manually migrate any remaining code⁷.

4. **Video Tutorials**: There are several video tutorials available online that provide step-by-step instructions on how to convert a Xamarin Forms project to a .NET MAUI project¹²³.

Remember, after running the tool or performing the manual migration, additional effort may be required to complete the migration⁴⁵. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
