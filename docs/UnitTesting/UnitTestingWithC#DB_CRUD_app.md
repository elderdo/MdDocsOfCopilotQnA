### Are there any complete examples of doing unit tests with C# and isolating a CRUD database application so it can be easily unit tested? Do they exist on Github?

Yes, there are several examples on GitHub that demonstrate unit testing in C# for CRUD database applications:

1. **alexmuab/unit-testing-csharp-example**: This repository provides an example of unit testing using C# and Visual Studio 2017¹.

2. **ABNERMATHEUS/UnitTest**: This repository contains a CRUD application for trucks, demonstrating unit testing in C#. It uses clean architecture, CQRS, and XUnit².

3. **cornflourblue/dotnet-6-crud-api**: This repository contains a .NET 6 CRUD API example⁴.

You can explore these repositories to understand how unit tests are implemented for CRUD operations in C#. Remember to check the README files for instructions on how to run the tests. Please note that these examples might not be specifically designed for database isolation, but they should give you a good starting point for understanding unit testing in C#. You may need to adapt the examples to fit your specific needs for isolating a database application.
