### Are there any complete examples of doing unit tests with C# and isolating Web apps or Web API apps? Do they exist on Github?

Yes, there are several examples on GitHub that demonstrate unit testing in C# for Web apps or Web API apps:

1. **KevinDockx/UnitTestingAspNetCoreWebApi**: This repository provides fully functioning sample code for unit testing an ASP.NET Core Web API¹.

2. **barisates/dotnet-core-xunit-example**: This repository contains a .NET Core Web API with xUnit for unit testing².

You can explore these repositories to understand how unit tests are implemented for Web apps or Web API apps. Remember to check the README files for instructions on how to run the tests. Please note that these examples might not be specifically designed for isolating a Web app or Web API app, but they should give you a good starting point for understanding unit testing in C#. You may need to adapt the examples to fit your specific needs for isolating a Web app or Web API app.
