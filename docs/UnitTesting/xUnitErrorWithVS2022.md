### I am using VS 2022, a simple console app, and a Class Library project with a [FACT] attribute for C#, it fails to run the test and I get a popup dialog saying "ServiceHub.LiveUnitTesting.exe has stopped working". Also, when I check the VS 2022 Test explorer, it shows the test in the "not run" category with the blue diamond containing an exclamation mark in the VS 2022 Test Explorer window. Is this a xUnit bug or a VS 2022 bug with a known solution? My code is in this repo: https://github.com/elderdo/xUnitExampleApps

The issue you're experiencing with "ServiceHub.LiveUnitTesting.exe has stopped working" and tests not running in Visual Studio 2022 could be due to several reasons. Here are some potential solutions:

1. **Update .NET Framework Version**: Ensure that the .NET Framework version installed on your machine matches the version required by your xUnit tests⁶.

2. **Check Dependencies and Configurations**: Verify that you have the required dependencies installed and your test configuration is correct⁶.

3. **Fix Broken Tests**: If there are any broken tests in your project, fixing them might resolve the issue⁶.

4. **Reinstall or Update VS 2022**: There have been instances where updating or reinstalling Visual Studio 2022 resolved similar issues².

5. **Check xUnit Attributes**: Ensure you're using the correct method attributes for xUnit. xUnit uses `[Fact]` / `[Theory]` only on methods, and doesn't use any attributes on test class types⁹.

6. **Configure Live Unit Testing**: You can configure Live Unit Testing by going to Test > Live Unit Testing > Configure Live Unit Testing for solution when Live Unit Testing is stopped¹.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, it might be helpful to post a detailed question on the Visual Studio Developer Community or Stack Overflow, including the specific error messages and any relevant code snippets. This will allow other developers who have encountered similar issues to provide guidance. Remember to always keep your software up-to-date and regularly check for any patches or updates that might resolve your issue.

### My PC has .NET Framework 4.5.50710, but it also has SDK 8.3.24.22415. What Framework effects execution of the xUnit which gets this popup error: “ServiceHub.LiveUnitTesting.exe has stopped working” ? Is there a log that VS 2022 can create to get more details about this error? If it does, how do I enable it and where do I look for the log or related logs?

The .NET Framework version that affects the execution of xUnit tests is the one specified in your test project's configuration. For example, if you want to support .NET Framework 4.8, you would change the `TargetFramework` element in your project file to `net48`⁴⁵.

As for logging, Visual Studio 2022 can indeed create logs to help diagnose issues. Here's how you can enable it:

1. **Verbose Logging**: You can set the logging level to verbose to get more detailed logs in the Output window². You can also display verbose output in the Live Unit Testing Output window by assigning a value of 1 to a user-level environment variable named `VS_UTE_DIAGNOSTICS`².

2. **MSBuild Log**: You can capture the MSBuild log by setting the `LiveUnitTesting_BuildLog` user environment variable to the name of the file you want to use to capture the log³.

After enabling these settings, you should be able to get more detailed information about the error you're encountering with `ServiceHub.LiveUnitTesting.exe`. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to the Visual Studio Developer Community or posting a detailed question on Stack Overflow for further assistance. Remember to include the specific error messages and any relevant code snippets in your post.

### When trying to run an xUnit test and using a .NET 8 class library project that contains my public test class and its public method with the [FACT] attribute, I checked the output of the Live Unit Test and get the following:

========== Test discovery aborted: 0 Tests found in 10 ms ==========
========== Starting test run ==========
========== Test run aborted: 0 Tests (0 Passed, 0 Failed, 0 Skipped) run in < 1 ms ==========

Why would the xUnit.runner.visualstudio version 2.8.2, xUnit version 2.9.0, xunit.runner.console version 2.9..0, and xunit version 2.9.0 issue this error? Is it because a class library project is being used to host the xUnit tests? I am following this [udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unit-testing-net-core-2x-applications-with-xunit-net) that is using the class library to host unit tests.

Found this answer on udemy that resolved the issue of not finding my xUnit test:
