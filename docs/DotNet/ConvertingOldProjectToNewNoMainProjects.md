I tried that with VS 2022, but although there are no Build errors it does not produce an exe in the bin directory. It does show an additional x86 directory, but I'm not sure where to go to make it all 64 bit and produce the exe file. Do you have any solutions?

To produce a single `.exe` file in Visual Studio 2022, you can follow these steps¬π:

1. Edit your publish profile settings.
2. Select Deployment mode as `Framework-dependent`.
3. Select the target runtime to something other than `Portable` (Produce single file is not available for `Portable`).
4. Under File Publish options, select `Produce single file`.
5. Save the profile settings and try publishing again.

This should produce a single `.exe` file in the bin directory¬π.

To change your project to 64-bit in Visual Studio 2022, you can follow these steps‚Åπ:

1. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer and select `Properties`.
2. In the Properties window, select the `Build` tab.
3. Change the `Platform target` to `x64`.
4. Save and close the Properties window.

Now, when you build your project, it should produce a 64-bit `.exe` file in the bin directory‚Åπ.

Please note that these changes should not break your `dotnet build` procedure or `docker-compose`¬π‚Åπ. If you're still facing issues, please let me know! I'm here to help.

In Visual Studio 2022, when you use the Publish tool, you're asked to choose a service to publish to. This could be an IIS server, an Azure service like App Service, a Docker container registry, or an FTP server¬π. The `Folder` option is one of the targets you can choose¬≤.

When you select `Folder` as your target, you're not limited to the default `bin\Debug\{TARGET FRAMEWORK MONIKER}\publish` folder‚Å¥. You can specify any folder location on your system where you want your application to be published‚Åµ.

For the **Deployment Settings**, follow these steps‚Å∂:

1. In the Solution Explorer, right-click your project and select `Properties`.
2. Click the `Build` tab in Project Designer.
3. In the Project contexts pane, for every project, select the Configuration and Platform you want, and select whether to Build it and whether to Deploy it.

Where are the publish profile settings and the Deployment settings for vs 2022? The publish tool is asking for a specific a Target. I am guessing it is Folder but isn't that the default that it creates the Debug folder under the bin automatically? What distinguishes the Project contexts pane and where does it indidcate "for every project"? I don't see that. Is there a video that demonstrates this setup?

In Visual Studio 2022, the **Publish Profile Settings** can be accessed by right-clicking your project in the Solution Explorer and selecting `Publish`. If you haven't previously configured any publishing profiles, you must then select `Create new profile`. Next, you can select your desired target, such as `Folder`, and specify the location where you want your application to be published¬π¬≥.

The **Deployment Settings** can be found in the `Project contexts` pane of the `Configuration Manager` dialog box‚Åµ. Here are the steps to access it‚Åµ:

1. In the Solution Explorer, right-click your solution node and select `Configuration Manager`.
2. In the `Configuration Manager` dialog box, you'll see the `Project contexts` pane which lists the projects in your solution.
3. For each project, you can select a project-specific configuration and platform, modify existing ones, or create a new configuration or add a new platform from a list of platforms supported by Visual Studio‚Åµ.

If you're having trouble finding these settings, here are some video tutorials that might help:
