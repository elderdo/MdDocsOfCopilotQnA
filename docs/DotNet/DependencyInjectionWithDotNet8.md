### Explain how .Net 8's dependency injection works?

Dependency Injection (DI) in .NET 8 is a design pattern that helps achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. Here's a concise overview of how it works:

1. **Service Registration**:
   - Services are registered in the application's `Program.cs` file.
   - You can register services with different lifetimes: 
     - **Transient**: Created each time they're requested.
     - **Scoped**: Created once per request.
     - **Singleton**: Created once and shared throughout the application's lifetime.

2. **Service Container**:
   - .NET provides a built-in service container, `IServiceProvider`.
   - Services are added to an `IServiceCollection` and then built into a service container using `BuildServiceProvider`.

3. **Service Injection**:
   - Services are injected into the constructors of the classes where they're used.
   - The framework takes responsibility for creating instances of dependencies and disposing of them when no longer needed.

4. **Example**:
   ```csharp
   // Define an interface
   public interface IMessageWriter
   {
       void Write(string message);
   }

   // Implement the interface
   public class MessageWriter : IMessageWriter
   {
       public void Write(string message)
       {
           Console.WriteLine($"Message: {message}");
       }
   }

   // Register the service in Program.cs
   var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
   builder.Services.AddTransient<IMessageWriter, MessageWriter>();

   // Inject the service into a class
   public class MyService
   {
       private readonly IMessageWriter _messageWriter;

       public MyService(IMessageWriter messageWriter)
       {
           _messageWriter = messageWriter;
       }

       public void DoWork()
       {
           _messageWriter.Write("Hello, Dependency Injection!");
       }
   }
   ```

This approach promotes modularity, testability, and ease of maintenance by decoupling the creation and use of objects¹².
