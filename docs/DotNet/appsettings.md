### question

What is the order of Settings for a C# .NET 8 application: when there could me command line arguments, Environment Variables, user secrets, appsettings.Production.json, appsettings.Staging.json, and appsettings.Development.json defined for a C# application?

### answer

In a C# .NET 8 application, the configuration settings are loaded in a specific order of precedence. This order determines which settings take priority when there are conflicts. Here is the typical order from highest to lowest priority:

1. **Command-line arguments**: These are specified when the application is started and have the highest priority⁴.
2. **Environment variables**: These can be set at the system or user level and are used to override settings for different environments⁴.
3. **User secrets**: These are used primarily during development to store sensitive information like API keys and connection strings⁴.
4. **appsettings.{Environment}.json**: These files are environment-specific configuration files. For example, `appsettings.Production.json`, `appsettings.Staging.json`, and `appsettings.Development.json`⁴.
5. **appsettings.json**: This is the base configuration file that is loaded first⁴.

### Example

If you have the following settings defined:

- `appsettings.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "Setting": "BaseValue"
  }
  ```

- `appsettings.Development.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "Setting": "DevelopmentValue"
  }
  ```

- Environment variable:

  ```sh
  SET Setting=EnvironmentValue
  ```

- Command-line argument:
  ```sh
  dotnet run --Setting CommandLineValue
  ```

The value of `Setting` will be `CommandLineValue` because command-line arguments have the highest priority.

### How to Configure

In your `Program.cs`, you typically set up the configuration like this:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Configuration
    .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: false, reloadOnChange: true)
    .AddJsonFile($"appsettings.{builder.Environment.EnvironmentName}.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true)
    .AddEnvironmentVariables()
    .AddUserSecrets<Program>(optional: true)
    .AddCommandLine(args);

var app = builder.Build();
```

This setup ensures that the configuration sources are loaded in the correct order.
