### Can you programmatically shut down an IIS server and make it unload all dll's for a website?

Yes, you can programmatically shut down an IIS server and unload all DLLs for a website. Here are a few methods:

1. **App_Offline.htm**: You can place a file named `app_offline.htm` in the root of your web application directory. This will cause ASP.NET to shut down the application, unload the application domain from the server, and stop processing any new incoming requests for that application¹. All DLLs can be safely overwritten when the site is offline. When you delete the `app_offline.htm` file, your application will start up the next time a request comes¹.

2. **Application Pool Settings**: You can modify the application pool settings in IIS. For instance, you can set the "Regular Time Interval (minutes)" property under the "Recycling" heading to zero to disable automatic recycling².

3. **AppDomain Unloading**: In .NET, you can create a new AppDomain, load the assembly (DLL) into this domain, and then unload the AppDomain when you're done. This will unload the DLL³.

Remember to always backup your data and test these methods in a controlled environment before applying them to a production server. Also, keep in mind that taking an application offline or recycling the application pool will disrupt service for users currently accessing the application. It's best to perform these actions during scheduled maintenance periods.
