### question

What is the best way to insure that the docker daemon is running on a Windows laptop?

### answer

To ensure the Docker daemon is running on your Windows laptop, follow these steps:

1. **Install Docker Desktop**: If you haven't already, download and install Docker Desktop for Windows from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

2. **Start Docker Desktop**: Once installed, Docker Desktop should start automatically. If it doesn't, you can manually start it by searching for "Docker Desktop" in the Start menu and launching it.

3. **Check Docker Status**: After starting Docker Desktop, you can check if the Docker daemon is running by opening a Command Prompt or PowerShell and typing:

   ```sh
   docker info
   ```

   This command will display information about the Docker daemon if it is running.

4. **Enable Docker to Start on Boot**: To ensure Docker starts automatically when you boot your laptop, you can enable it in the startup settings:

   - Open the Start menu and type "Startup Apps".
   - Find Docker Desktop in the list and toggle it on.

5. **Verify Docker Daemon**: You can also verify the Docker daemon by running a simple Docker command, such as:
   ```sh
   docker run hello-world
   ```
   This command will pull a test image and run it, confirming that Docker is working correctly.

If you encounter any issues, you can refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/daemon/) for more detailed troubleshooting steps⁴⁵.
