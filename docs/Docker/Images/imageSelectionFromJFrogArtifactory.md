### question

I inspected the oralcelinux image I have, but I cannot tell if this image will allow me to create an Oracle database. How do I determine if an image can do that when the inspect show a JSON file that really doesn't tell me if it can or cannot run a database? What should I be looking for in the JSON file or is there an easier way to do this? Keep in mind that I am limited to pulling images only from a JFrog Artifactory as sres.web.boeing.com:6000. When I search the JFrog Artifactory with my browser, I only see 3 Items with the Docker Icon to the left of them: oraclelinux, oraclelinux/oraclelinux. I do see some with an rpm icon, I'm not sure what those are, although there are more of them and on has npm as an icon and it says oracledb. It is all a bit confusing on what I should pick. Can you help with the above limited descriptions of my JFrog Artifactory?

### answer

To determine if a Docker image can run an Oracle database, you can follow these steps:

1. **Check the Docker Hub or Documentation**: Look for the official documentation or Docker Hub page for the image. For example, the [oraclelinux Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/oraclelinux/) provides information about the image and its capabilities¹¹.

2. **Inspect the JSON File**: When you inspect the JSON file, look for the `Entrypoint` and `Cmd` fields. These fields indicate the default command that runs when the container starts. If the image is designed to run an Oracle database, these fields might reference database-related commands or scripts.

3. **Search for Specific Tags**: In JFrog Artifactory, look for images with tags that indicate they are designed for Oracle databases. For example, images tagged with `oracle-database` or similar.

4. **Use Docker Commands**: You can try running the image with typical Oracle database commands to see if it supports them. For example:
   ```sh
   docker run -d --name oracle-db oraclelinux:latest
   docker exec -it oracle-db sqlplus / as sysdba
   ```

Regarding the icons in JFrog Artifactory:

- **Docker Icon**: Indicates Docker images.
- **RPM Icon**: Indicates RPM packages, which are typically used for installing software on Linux distributions.
- **NPM Icon**: Indicates Node.js packages, which might include database-related packages like `oracledb`.

Given your constraints, you should look for Docker images specifically designed for Oracle databases. If you only see `oraclelinux` images, they might not include the Oracle database software by default. You might need to install the database software manually within the container or look for a more specific image.

If you have further questions or need more detailed guidance, feel free to ask!
