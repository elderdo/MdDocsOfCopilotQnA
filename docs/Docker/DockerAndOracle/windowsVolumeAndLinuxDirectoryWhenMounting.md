### question

When I run a docker image for Oracle and I need to override the tnsnames.ora, how should the mount be written when the host file is on a Windows PC and the image starts up in a Linux environment? Do I specify the Windows volume with the backslash and the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora file like this in a windows bat file: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\IPDM\oracle\tnsnames.ora:$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/tnsnames.ora or is there another format that I should use?

### answer

When mounting a file from a Windows host to a Docker container running in a Linux environment, you need to use the correct path format for both the host and the container. In a Windows batch file, you should use the Windows path format for the host file and the Linux path format for the container.

Here's how you can specify the mount in a Windows batch file:

```batch
docker run -v %USERPROFILE%\Documents\IPDM\oracle\tnsnames.ora:/opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/network/admin/tnsnames.ora oracle/database:19.3.0-ee
```

### Explanation:

- **%USERPROFILE%\Documents\IPDM\oracle\tnsnames.ora**: This is the path to the `tnsnames.ora` file on your Windows host. `%USERPROFILE%` is an environment variable that points to the current user's profile directory.
- **/opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/network/admin/tnsnames.ora**: This is the path inside the Docker container where the `tnsnames.ora` file should be placed. Adjust this path according to your Oracle installation directory inside the container.

### Steps:

1. **Ensure Docker is running** on your Windows machine.
2. **Create a batch file** (e.g., `run_oracle.bat`) with the above command.
3. **Run the batch file** by double-clicking it or executing it from the command line.

This setup will mount the `tnsnames.ora` file from your Windows host to the specified location inside the Docker container, allowing you to override the default `tnsnames.ora` file.
