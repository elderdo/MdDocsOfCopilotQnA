### question

For the -v /path/to/your/tnsnames.ora:/opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/network/admin/tnsnames.ora \
 oracle-db:19c of the run command why is the second path specified? Does the -v constitute the mount option of the run command?

### answer

Yes, the `-v` option in the `docker run` command is used to mount a volume, which allows you to map a file or directory from your host machine to a file or directory inside the container.

### Breakdown of the `-v` Option

The `-v` option syntax is:

```bash
-v /path/on/host:/path/in/container
```

- **`/path/on/host`**: This is the path to the file or directory on your host machine that you want to mount.
- **`/path/in/container`**: This is the path inside the container where the file or directory will be accessible.

### Example Explained

```bash
docker run -d --name oracle-db \
  -p 1521:1521 -p 5500:5500 \
  -v /path/to/your/tnsnames.ora:/opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/network/admin/tnsnames.ora \
  oracle-db:19c
```

- **`-v /path/to/your/tnsnames.ora:/opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/network/admin/tnsnames.ora`**:
  - **`/path/to/your/tnsnames.ora`**: This is the path to your custom `tnsnames.ora` file on your host machine.
  - **`/opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/network/admin/tnsnames.ora`**: This is the path inside the Oracle container where the `tnsnames.ora` file is expected to be located.

By using the `-v` option, you are effectively replacing the default `tnsnames.ora` file inside the container with your custom file from the host. This allows you to customize the Oracle network configuration without modifying the container image itself.

### Purpose of the Second Path

The second path (`/opt/oracle/product/19c/dbhome_1/network/admin/tnsnames.ora`) is specified to ensure that the Oracle database inside the container uses your custom `tnsnames.ora` file for its network configuration. This path is where Oracle expects to find the `tnsnames.ora` file.

### Summary

- **`-v` Option**: Used to mount a volume, mapping a host file/directory to a container file/directory.
- **Second Path**: Specifies the location inside the container where the file should be accessible.
- **Customization**: Allows you to customize the Oracle configuration without altering the container image.
