### question

Can you list some YouTube videos that explain how to use docker and create a C# .NET 8 Oracle DB application and can you give any example github repositories that have examples for this type of project. In other words code that can be used to quickly jump start a new project.

### answer

Absolutely! Here are some YouTube videos and GitHub repositories that can help you get started with Docker, C# .NET 8, and Oracle DB applications:

### YouTube Tutorials

1. **[Develop .NET 8 application with Docker using Visual Studio 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjqBCRn-XnI)** - This video walks you through creating a .NET 8 Web API project, adding a Dockerfile, and managing the container using Visual Studio 2022¹.

2. **[How to Set Up Oracle Database with Docker (Official Container Image)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56dSXI2PbCQ)** - This tutorial covers setting up an Oracle database using Docker, including downloading the image, running the container, and connecting to the database with SQL Developer².

3. **[Integrating Docker with a .NET Web API - A Step-by-Step Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wp2zJHs9l0)** - This video explains the basics of Docker, creating a Dockerfile for a .NET Web API, and best practices for using Docker with .NET applications³.

### GitHub Repositories

1. **[oracle/dotnet-db-samples](https://github.com/oracle/dotnet-db-samples)** - This repository provides .NET code samples for Oracle database developers, including examples using Oracle Data Provider for .NET (ODP.NET) and other Oracle .NET components⁷.

2. **[petrfaltus/oracle-database-connection-source-codes](https://github.com/petrfaltus/oracle-database-connection-source-codes)** - This repository contains console applications for connecting to Oracle databases, updating rows, reading tables, and calling stored procedures. It includes Docker configurations and SQL initialization scripts⁸.

These resources should help you get started with your project. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
