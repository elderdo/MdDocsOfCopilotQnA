elderdo: what repository does docker look at when running this command docker pull oracle/database:19.3.0-ee

GitHub Copilot: When you run the command:

```sh
docker pull oracle/database:19.3.0-ee
```

Docker looks at Docker Hub by default, which is the default public registry for Docker images. In this case, it will look for the `oracle/database` image with the tag `19.3.0-ee` on Docker Hub.

If the image is not found on Docker Hub, Docker will return an error indicating that the image could not be found.

elderdo: What if there is a firewall to go through how do I configure docker to use it like my browser does?

GitHub Copilot: To configure Docker to use a proxy server, you need to set the proxy settings for Docker. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Create or Edit Docker Daemon Configuration:**
   Create or edit the `daemon.json` file to include your proxy settings. This file is typically located at `C:\ProgramData\Docker\config\daemon.json` on Windows.

2. **Add Proxy Configuration:**
   Add the following JSON configuration to the `daemon.json` file, replacing `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` with your actual proxy settings:

   ```json
   {
     "proxies": {
       "default": {
         "httpProxy": "http://your-proxy-server:port",
         "httpsProxy": "http://your-proxy-server:port",
         "noProxy": "localhost,127.0.0.1"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Restart Docker:**
   After saving the changes to `daemon.json`, restart Docker for the changes to take effect. You can do this by right-clicking the Docker icon in the system tray and selecting "Restart Docker Desktop".

4. **Set Environment Variables (Optional):**
   You can also set the proxy environment variables in your terminal session. This is useful if you need to configure proxy settings temporarily.

   ```sh
   set HTTP_PROXY=http://your-proxy-server:port
   set HTTPS_PROXY=http://your-proxy-server:port
   set NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1
   ```

5. **Verify Configuration:**
   You can verify that Docker is using the proxy settings by running a Docker command and checking if it successfully connects through the proxy.

By following these steps, Docker should be able to use the proxy server to connect to the internet, similar to how your browser does.

elderdo: how do I find my proxy settings for ms edge?

GitHub Copilot: To find your proxy settings for Microsoft Edge, follow these steps:

1. **Open Microsoft Edge:**
   Launch Microsoft Edge on your Windows machine.

2. **Open Settings:**
   Click on the three-dot menu (⋮) in the upper-right corner of the browser window and select "Settings."

3. **Navigate to System Settings:**
   In the left-hand menu, scroll down and click on "System and performance."

4. **Open Proxy Settings:**
   Under the "System" section, click on "Open your computer's proxy settings." This will open the Windows proxy settings.

5. **View Proxy Settings:**
   In the Windows proxy settings window, you can view your current proxy configuration under the "Manual proxy setup" section. Here, you will see the address and port of the proxy server you are using.

These settings are what Microsoft Edge uses to connect to the internet through a proxy server. You can use these same settings to configure Docker to use the proxy.

elderdo: How do you set env var's for powershell?

GitHub Copilot: To set environment variables in PowerShell, you can use the `$env:` prefix. Here’s how you can set and verify environment variables:

1. **Set Environment Variables:**

   ```powershell
   $env:HTTP_PROXY = "http://your-proxy-server:port"
   $env:HTTPS_PROXY = "http://your-proxy-server:port"
   $env:NO_PROXY = "localhost,127.0.0.1"
   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables:**

   ```powershell
   echo $env:HTTP_PROXY
   echo $env:HTTPS_PROXY
   echo $env:NO_PROXY
   ```

3. **Persist Environment Variables (Optional):**
   If you want these environment variables to persist across PowerShell sessions, you can add the above commands to your PowerShell profile script. The profile script is typically located at `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Documents\PowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`.

   To edit the profile script, you can run:

   ```powershell
   notepad $PROFILE
   ```

   Then add the environment variable settings to the file and save it.

By following these steps, you can set and verify environment variables in PowerShell.

GitHub Copilot: To run and start an Oracle database in a Docker container, you typically need to use a pre-configured Oracle database Docker image that includes all the necessary setup and configuration. Here’s a step-by-step guide to running an Oracle database in a Docker container:

1. **Pull the Oracle Database Image:**
   Ensure you have the correct Oracle database Docker image. If you don't have it, you can pull it from the Oracle Container Registry or Docker Hub. For example:

   ```sh
   docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:19.3.0.0
   ```

2. **Run the Oracle Database Container:**
   Run the Oracle database container with the necessary environment variables and ports. Here’s an example command:

   ```sh
   docker run -d --name oracle-db \
     -p 1521:1521 -p 5500:5500 \
     -e ORACLE_SID=ORCLCDB \
     -e ORACLE_PDB=ORCLPDB1 \
     -e ORACLE_PWD=YourPassword \
     -e ORACLE_CHARACTERSET=AL32UTF8 \
     container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:19.3.0.0
   ```

   Replace `YourPassword` with a secure password for the Oracle database.

3. **Check Container Logs:**
   Check the logs to ensure the Oracle database is starting correctly:

   ```sh
   docker logs -f oracle-db
   ```

4. **Connect to the Oracle Database:**
   Once the database is up and running, you can connect to it using SQL*Plus or any other Oracle database client. For example, using SQL*Plus from within the container:
   ```sh
   docker exec -it oracle-db sqlplus sys/YourPassword@ORCLCDB as sysdba
   ```

### Example Steps:

1. **Pull the Oracle Database Image:**

   ```sh
   docker pull container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:19.3.0.0
   ```

2. **Run the Oracle Database Container:**

   ```sh
   docker run -d --name oracle-db \
     -p 1521:1521 -p 5500:5500 \
     -e ORACLE_SID=ORCLCDB \
     -e ORACLE_PDB=ORCLPDB1 \
     -e ORACLE_PWD=YourPassword \
     -e ORACLE_CHARACTERSET=AL32UTF8 \
     container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:19.3.0.0
   ```

3. **Check Container Logs:**

   ```sh
   docker logs -f oracle-db
   ```

4. **Connect to the Oracle Database:**
   ```sh
   docker exec -it oracle-db sqlplus sys/YourPassword@ORCLCDB as sysdba
   ```

### Notes:

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions and licenses to use the Oracle database Docker image.
- Replace `YourPassword` with a secure password.
- The ports `1521` and `5500` are the default ports for Oracle database and Enterprise Manager, respectively. Adjust them if needed.

By following these steps, you can run and start an Oracle database in a Docker container.

elderdo: This docker pull sres.web.boeing.com:6000/oraclelinux:8 worked. How do I determine the name of the Oracle Database Container?

GitHub Copilot: If you have successfully pulled the `oraclelinux:8` image from your registry, but you need to determine the name of the Oracle Database container, you should first ensure that you have the correct Oracle Database image. The `oraclelinux:8` image is a base Linux image and does not contain the Oracle Database software.

Assuming you have the correct Oracle Database image, you can list all running containers and their names using the following command:

```sh
docker ps
```

This command will display a list of all running containers, including their container IDs, names, and other details.

If you need to find the name of a specific Oracle Database container, you can look for containers that are running an Oracle Database image. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **List All Containers:**

   ```sh
   docker ps -a
   ```

   This command lists all containers, including those that are stopped.

2. **Filter by Image Name:**
   If you know the image name or part of it, you can filter the list to find the specific container. For example:

   ```sh
   docker ps -a --filter "ancestor=oracle/database"
   ```

   Replace `oracle/database` with the actual name of your Oracle Database image.

3. **Check Container Details:**
   Once you have identified the container, you can inspect its details using:
   ```sh
   docker inspect <container_id_or_name>
   ```

### Example Steps:

1. **List All Containers:**

   ```sh
   docker ps -a
   ```

2. **Filter by Image Name:**

   ```sh
   docker ps -a --filter "ancestor=oracle/database"
   ```

3. **Inspect Container Details:**
   ```sh
   docker inspect <container_id_or_name>
   ```

### Notes:

- If you have not yet run the Oracle Database container, you need to pull the correct Oracle Database image and run it as described in the previous response.
- Ensure you have the correct Oracle Database image. The `oraclelinux:8` image is a base Linux image and does not contain the Oracle Database software.

By following these steps, you can determine the name of the Oracle Database container and inspect its details.

elderdo: How can I start and run an Oracle Database container using the `oraclelinux:8` image I pulled?

GitHub Copilot: To start and run an Oracle Database container, you need an image that includes the Oracle Database software. The `oraclelinux:8` image is a base Linux image and does not contain the Oracle Database software. However, you can use this image as a base to create your own Dockerfile that installs and configures Oracle Database.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to create a Dockerfile that sets up Oracle Database on the `oraclelinux:8` image:

1. **Create a Dockerfile:**
   Create a new file named `Dockerfile` and add the following content to it. This example assumes you have the Oracle Database installation files available.

   ```Dockerfile
   # Use the oraclelinux:8 base image
   FROM oraclelinux:8

   # Set environment variables
   ENV ORACLE_BASE=/opt/oracle
   ENV ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_BASE/product/19c/dbhome_1
   ENV ORACLE_SID=ORCLCDB
   ENV PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH

   # Copy Oracle installation files to the container
   COPY oracle-database-ee-19c-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm /tmp/

   # Install Oracle Database
   RUN yum install -y /tmp/oracle-database-ee-19c-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm && \
       rm -f /tmp/oracle-database-ee-19c-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm

   # Run Oracle setup script
   RUN /etc/init.d/oracledb_ORCLCDB-19c configure

   # Expose Oracle ports
   EXPOSE 1521 5500

   # Start Oracle Database
   CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "source /etc/profile && /etc/init.d/oracledb_ORCLCDB-19c start && tail -f /dev/null"]
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image:**
   Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile you created.

   ```sh
   docker build -t my-oracle-database .
   ```

3. **Run the Oracle Database Container:**
   Run a container from the image you built.

   ```sh
   docker run -d --name oracle-db \
     -p 1521:1521 -p 5500:5500 \
     my-oracle-database
   ```

4. **Check Container Logs:**
   Check the logs to ensure the Oracle Database is starting correctly.

   ```sh
   docker logs -f oracle-db
   ```

5. **Connect to the Oracle Database:**
   Once the database is up and running, you can connect to it using SQL\*Plus or any other Oracle database client.

   ```sh
   docker exec -it oracle-db sqlplus sys/YourPassword@ORCLCDB as sysdba
   ```

### Notes:

- Replace `oracle-database-ee-19c-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm` with the actual Oracle Database RPM file you have.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions and licenses to use Oracle Database.
- Adjust environment variables and paths as needed based on your Oracle Database version and installation files.

By following these steps, you can create a Docker image that sets up and runs Oracle Database using the `oraclelinux:8` base image.

elderdo: How do I determine what version of Oracle is available with this docker docker pull sres.web.boeing.com:6000/oraclelinux:8? Your Dockerfile example is assuming Oracle 19c. I am not sure what version the pull returned.

GitHub Copilot: The `oraclelinux:8` image you pulled is a base image for Oracle Linux and does not include Oracle Database software. To determine the version of Oracle Database available, you need to pull an image specifically designed for Oracle Database.

However, if you want to check the available Oracle Database versions in your JFrog Artifactory repository, you can do the following:

1. **Browse the Repository:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to your JFrog Artifactory URL: `https://sres.web.boeing.com/ui/packages`.

2. **Locate the Docker Repository:**
   In the Artifactory UI, go to the "Artifacts" tab and locate the Docker repository that contains Oracle Database images.

3. **Check Available Versions:**
   Browse through the repository to see the available Oracle Database images and their tags. The tags usually indicate the version of Oracle Database.

### Example Steps to Pull a Specific Oracle Database Image:

1. **Identify the Correct Image:**
   Once you have identified the correct Oracle Database image and version from the Artifactory UI, note down the image name and tag.

2. **Pull the Oracle Database Image:**
   Use the Docker CLI to pull the specific Oracle Database image. For example, if the image is `sres.web.boeing.com:6000/oracle-database:19.3.0`, you can pull it using:

   ```sh
   docker pull sres.web.boeing.com:6000/oracle-database:19.3.0
   ```

3. **Run the Oracle Database Container:**
   Run a container from the pulled image. For example:
   ```sh
   docker run -d --name oracle-db \
     -p 1521:1521 -p 5500:5500 \
     sres.web.boeing.com:6000/oracle-database:19.3.0
   ```

### Example Steps to Check the Version of an Existing Image:

If you have already pulled an image and want to check its version, you can inspect the image using the following command:

1. **List Docker Images:**

   ```sh
   docker images
   ```

   This command lists all the images you have pulled, including their tags and IDs.

2. **Inspect the Image:**
   Use the `docker inspect` command to get detailed information about the image. For example:

   ```sh
   docker inspect sres.web.boeing.com:6000/oraclelinux:8
   ```

   Look for labels or other metadata that might indicate the version of Oracle Database included in the image.

### Notes:

- The `oraclelinux:8` image is a base Linux image and does not include Oracle Database software. You need to pull an image specifically designed for Oracle Database.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions and licenses to use Oracle Database images from your repository.

By following these steps, you can determine the available Oracle Database versions in your JFrog Artifactory repository and pull the correct image for your needs.

elderdo: The only artifacts I see in our JFrog is an oracle zip file for OracleXE213_Win64.zip. I am guessing this sets up a version of Oracle Express, but I am not sure what the XE213 means. Any answers on its meaning?

GitHub Copilot: The file name `OracleXE213_Win64.zip` likely refers to Oracle Database Express Edition (XE) version 21.3 for 64-bit Windows. Here's a breakdown of the components in the file name:

- **OracleXE**: Indicates that this is Oracle Database Express Edition (XE), which is a free, lightweight, and limited version of Oracle Database.
- **213**: This likely refers to the version number, which is 21.3. Oracle Database versioning typically follows a pattern where the first two digits represent the major version (21), and the third digit represents the release update (3).
- **Win64**: Indicates that this is a 64-bit version for Windows operating systems.

### Steps to Set Up Oracle Database Express Edition (XE) in Docker

Since you have the `OracleXE213_Win64.zip` file, you can create a Docker image that sets up Oracle Database Express Edition (XE) using this zip file. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Prepare the Dockerfile:**
   Create a new file named `Dockerfile` and add the following content to it. This example assumes you have the OracleXE213_Win64.zip file available.

   ```Dockerfile
   # Use the oraclelinux:8 base image
   FROM oraclelinux:8

   # Set environment variables
   ENV ORACLE_BASE=/opt/oracle
   ENV ORACLE_HOME=$ORACLE_BASE/product/21c/dbhomeXE
   ENV ORACLE_SID=XE
   ENV PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH

   # Copy Oracle XE installation files to the container
   COPY OracleXE213_Win64.zip /tmp/

   # Install necessary packages
   RUN yum install -y unzip && \
       yum install -y oracle-database-preinstall-21c

   # Unzip and install Oracle XE
   RUN unzip /tmp/OracleXE213_Win64.zip -d /tmp/ && \
       /tmp/Disk1/runInstaller -silent -responseFile /tmp/response/db_install.rsp && \
       rm -rf /tmp/OracleXE213_Win64.zip /tmp/Disk1

   # Expose Oracle ports
   EXPOSE 1521 5500

   # Start Oracle Database
   CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "source /etc/profile && /etc/init.d/oracle-xe-21c start && tail -f /dev/null"]
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image:**
   Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile you created.

   ```sh
   docker build -t my-oracle-xe .
   ```

3. **Run the Oracle Database Container:**
   Run a container from the image you built.

   ```sh
   docker run -d --name oracle-xe \
     -p 1521:1521 -p 5500:5500 \
     my-oracle-xe
   ```

4. **Check Container Logs:**
   Check the logs to ensure the Oracle Database XE is starting correctly.

   ```sh
   docker logs -f oracle-xe
   ```

5. **Connect to the Oracle Database:**
   Once the database is up and running, you can connect to it using SQL\*Plus or any other Oracle database client.

   ```sh
   docker exec -it oracle-xe sqlplus sys/YourPassword@XE as sysdba
   ```

### Notes:

- Replace `OracleXE213_Win64.zip` with the actual path to your Oracle XE zip file.
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions and licenses to use Oracle Database XE.
- Adjust environment variables and paths as needed based on your Oracle Database XE version and installation files.

By following these steps, you can create a Docker image that sets up and runs Oracle Database Express Edition (XE) using the `OracleXE213_Win64.zip` file.
