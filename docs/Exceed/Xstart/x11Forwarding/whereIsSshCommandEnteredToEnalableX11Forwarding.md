### question

Where in Exceed is the ssh command entered to enable x11 forwarding? Also, could you explain how all this is working? I am not familiar with x11 forwarding. I am familiar with ssh and its utilization of public and private key pairs for authentication. Can you explain how this protocol works so that an xterm is created by the Exceed software?

### answer

### Enabling X11 Forwarding in Exceed

To enable X11 forwarding in Exceed, follow these steps:

1. **Open Exceed**: Launch the Exceed application on your PC.
2. **Configure SSH**:
   - Open the SSH Secure Shell Client.
   - Go to `Edit` > `Settings`.
   - Under `Profile Settings`, click `Tunneling`.
   - Check the box next to `Tunnel X11 Connections`.
   - Click `OK` to save the settings⁸.

### How X11 Forwarding Works

X11 forwarding allows you to run graphical applications on a remote server and display them on your local machine. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

1. **X11 Protocol**: X11 is a protocol for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on Unix-like operating systems. It uses a client-server model where:

   - **X Server**: Runs on your local machine and manages the display and input devices (keyboard, mouse, etc.).
   - **X Client**: Runs on the remote server and handles the graphical application.

2. **SSH Tunnel**: When you enable X11 forwarding, SSH creates a secure tunnel between your local machine and the remote server. This tunnel encrypts the data transmitted between the X Client and X Server.

   - **SSH Server**: Proxies the remote X Client connection to the SSH Client.
   - **SSH Client**: Proxies the connection to your local X Server¹.

3. **Running xterm**: When you run the `xterm` command on the remote server, the X Client (xterm) sends graphical data through the SSH tunnel to your local X Server, which then displays the xterm window on your local machine.

### Steps to Create an xterm with Exceed

1. **Enable X11 Forwarding**: Ensure X11 forwarding is enabled in your SSH configuration.
2. **Connect via SSH**: Use the SSH client to connect to the remote server with X11 forwarding enabled:
   ```sh
   ssh -X user@ssd-sw-3000
   ```
3. **Run xterm**: Execute the xterm command on the remote server:
   ```sh
   xterm -bg black -fg white &
   ```

This setup allows you to securely run and display graphical applications from the remote server on your local machine.
