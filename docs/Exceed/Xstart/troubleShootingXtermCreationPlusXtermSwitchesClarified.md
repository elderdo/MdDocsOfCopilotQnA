### question

I am having trouble getting the Exceed XStart to start an xterm on my PC. I have entered the correct host: ssd-sw-3000, the user id and its password. The combination works with the PuTTY utility. I've entered command: xterm -s1 80 -fn 10x20 -bg red -fg white &
When I run this xstart I get a popup Tunnel for my host and the banner indicating it connected with an OK button that is partially visible. The popup is not resizable, but I am able to click the OK button, the window closes but I don't get a usable xterm. I don't understand the -fn option and what kind of font, font size or whether it is bold. What colors are available with -bg and -fg switches? How do I get a usuable terminal that works. I want to be able to display files like Windows Explorer does so I can download and upload to the server by dragging and dropping files to this type of window. How do I get that window with the Exceed tool?

### answer

It sounds like you're encountering a few issues with Exceed XStart and xterm. Let's address them one by one:

### Understanding the `-fn` Option

The `-fn` option in xterm specifies the font to use. In your command, `10x20` is a font name that specifies a fixed-width font with a size of 10 pixels wide and 20 pixels high. This font is not bold by default.

### Available Colors for `-bg` and `-fg` Switches

The `-bg` (background) and `-fg` (foreground) switches in xterm allow you to set the colors. Here are some common color names you can use:

- **Background (`-bg`)**: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, gray, darkblue, darkred, etc.
- **Foreground (`-fg`)**: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, gray, darkblue, darkred, etc.

### Getting a Usable xterm

To get a usable xterm, you might want to simplify your command and ensure that your SSH connection is properly forwarding X11. Here’s a simplified command:

```sh
xterm -bg black -fg white &
```

Make sure that X11 forwarding is enabled in your SSH configuration. You can do this by adding `-X` to your SSH command:

```sh
ssh -X user@ssd-sw-3000
```

### Displaying Files Like Windows Explorer

Exceed itself does not provide a file explorer-like interface. However, you can use other tools to achieve this functionality. One option is to use a graphical file manager like `nautilus` or `thunar` over X11 forwarding. Here’s how you can start `nautilus`:

```sh
nautilus &
```

Ensure that you have `nautilus` installed on your remote server.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check X11 Forwarding**: Ensure that X11 forwarding is enabled in your SSH configuration.
2. **Simplify xterm Command**: Start with a basic xterm command and gradually add options.
3. **Use a Graphical File Manager**: Use `nautilus` or `thunar` for a file explorer-like interface.

If you continue to experience issues, you might want to consult the [OpenText Exceed User's Guide](2) for more detailed troubleshooting steps.
