### question

Can you tailor your previous answer to version 15.07.488 of Exceed. There are many utilities listed for Open Text Exceed 15 x64. Which tool would have the "Exceed application" with the "SSH Secure Shell Client"? It is not obvious what tool to use. I have used its Connection Central in the past and it did have the ability to display files like Windows Explorer and do drag and drop to allown for uploading and download of files. Howerver, the tool and its multitude of utilities are not intuitive to use nor is its help easy to just get it easily configured to perform tasks like creating an xterm or providing a file file for the Linux server that is similar to Windows Explorer. Can you simplify how this software should be setup for a Linux server to have an xterm and a file explorer as I have used previously?

### answer

### Enabling X11 Forwarding in Exceed 15.07.488

To enable X11 forwarding in Exceed 15.07.488, follow these steps:

1. **Open Exceed**: Launch the Exceed application from the OpenText Exceed 15 x64 suite.
2. **Configure SSH**:
   - Open the **SSH Secure Shell Client**.
   - Go to `Edit` > `Settings`.
   - Under `Profile Settings`, click `Tunneling`.
   - Check the box next to `Tunnel X11 Connections`.
   - Click `OK` to save the settings.

### How X11 Forwarding Works

X11 forwarding allows you to run graphical applications on a remote server and display them on your local machine. Here's a simplified explanation:

1. **X11 Protocol**: X11 uses a client-server model where:

   - **X Server**: Runs on your local machine and manages the display and input devices.
   - **X Client**: Runs on the remote server and handles the graphical application.

2. **SSH Tunnel**: When you enable X11 forwarding, SSH creates a secure tunnel between your local machine and the remote server. This tunnel encrypts the data transmitted between the X Client and X Server.

3. **Running xterm**: When you run the `xterm` command on the remote server, the X Client (xterm) sends graphical data through the SSH tunnel to your local X Server, which then displays the xterm window on your local machine.

### Steps to Create an xterm with Exceed 15.07.488

1. **Enable X11 Forwarding**: Ensure X11 forwarding is enabled in your SSH configuration.
2. **Connect via SSH**: Use the SSH client to connect to the remote server with X11 forwarding enabled:
   ```sh
   ssh -X user@remote_server
   ```
3. **Run xterm**: Execute the xterm command on the remote server:
   ```sh
   xterm -bg black -fg white &
   ```

### Using File Explorer in Exceed 15.07.488

To use a file explorer similar to Windows Explorer for uploading and downloading files:

1. **Open Connection Central**: Launch the Connection Central utility from the OpenText Exceed 15 x64 suite.
2. **Connect to the Server**: Use Connection Central to connect to your Linux server.
3. **File Management**: Use the file management interface to drag and drop files for uploading and downloading.

This setup allows you to securely run and display graphical applications from the remote server on your local machine and manage files efficiently.
