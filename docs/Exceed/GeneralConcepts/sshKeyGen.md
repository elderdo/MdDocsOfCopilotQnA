### question

For Exceed 15 how can a user generate a set of private and public keys for ssh? Does Exceed 15 have a gui to run the ssh-keygen command and create those keys?

### answer

OpenText Exceed 15 does not have a built-in GUI to generate SSH keys. However, you can use the `ssh-keygen` command from the command line to create a set of private and public keys. Here are the steps:

### Generating SSH Keys

1. **Open Command Prompt**:

   - On your Windows machine, open the Command Prompt.

2. **Run ssh-keygen**:

   - Type the following command and press Enter:
     ```sh
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "your_email@example.com"
     ```
   - This command generates a new SSH key pair using the RSA algorithm with a 2048-bit key length.

3. **Follow the Prompts**:

   - You will be prompted to specify a file to save the key. Press Enter to accept the default location (`C:\Users\your_username\.ssh\id_rsa`).
   - Next, you will be asked to enter a passphrase. You can leave this empty for passwordless authentication by pressing Enter twice.

4. **Locate Your Keys**:
   - Your private key will be saved as `id_rsa` and your public key as `id_rsa.pub` in the `.ssh` directory.

### Using the Keys in Exceed 15

1. **Copy Public Key to Remote Server**:

   - Use the following command to copy your public key to the remote server:
     ```sh
     ssh-copy-id user@remote_host
     ```
   - Replace `user` and `remote_host` with your actual username and server address.

2. **Configure Exceed 15**:
   - Follow the steps mentioned in the previous response to configure Exceed 15 to use your private key for SSH connections.

By following these steps, you can generate SSH keys and configure Exceed 15 for passwordless SSH connections. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
