Yes, Visual Studio Code solutions can be hooked up to a CI/CD pipeline. Here are some methods to do so:

1. **Azure Pipelines**: Azure Pipelines is a great tool for running VS Code extension tests as it supports running the tests on Windows, macOS, and Linux¹. You can set up an Azure Pipelines for running your extension tests¹.

2. **GitHub Actions**: You can build a full CI/CD pipeline for a VS Code extension using GitHub Actions². This allows you to run tests on Mac, Windows, and Linux, create a new GitHub release with automatic release notes based on Angular Commit Message Conventions, and publish the new version to Visual Studio’s marketplace².

Remember, after setting up the CI/CD pipeline, you may need to customize it according to your project's needs¹. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
