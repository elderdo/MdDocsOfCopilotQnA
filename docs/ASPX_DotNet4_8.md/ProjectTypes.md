### For a .NET 4.8 C# ASPX application what should the output type be for the project: Windows Application or Class Library?

For a .NET 4.8 C# ASPX application, the output type for the project should be a **Class Library**⁴. This is because ASPX applications are web applications and they don't produce an executable (.exe) like a Windows Application would. Instead, they are compiled into a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) that runs on a web server⁴. So, when you're setting up your project in Visual Studio, you should choose "Class Library" as the output type³. This will ensure that your project compiles correctly for use as a web application.
