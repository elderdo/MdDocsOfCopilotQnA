### For older .Net 4.8 C# ASPX applications how is a Default.aspx loaded or executed and what determines what web server should be simulated?

In older .NET 4.8 C# ASPX applications, the `Default.aspx` page is typically loaded or executed as the default page of the application. This is determined by the configuration in the `web.config` file of the application. The `<defaultDocument>` element within the `<system.webServer>` section of the `web.config` file specifies the default page¹. Here's an example:

```xml
<system.webServer>
    <defaultDocument>
        <files>
            <clear />
            <add value="Default.aspx" />
        </files>
    </defaultDocument>
</system.webServer>
```

In this example, `Default.aspx` is set as the default page. When a user navigates to the root of your application, the server will serve the `Default.aspx` page¹.

As for the web server to be simulated, it's typically determined by the development environment and the deployment target. During development, you might use IIS Express or the Visual Studio Development Server, both of which can simulate the behavior of IIS⁶. For deployment, you might use IIS or another compatible server. The choice of server can affect the behavior of your application, so it's important to test your application in an environment that closely matches your production environment⁶.

Please note that the server's configuration and the .NET Framework version installed on the server can also affect how your application runs⁶. If you're having issues running your application on a specific server, you might need to check the server's configuration and ensure the required .NET Framework version is installed⁶.
