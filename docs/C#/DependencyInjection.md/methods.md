### question
Can you list and review the dependency injection methods such as AddScoped and give examples of each?

### answer
Sure! In ASP.NET Core, dependency injection is a fundamental part of the framework. It allows you to manage the lifecycle of your services and ensure that dependencies are provided where needed. Here are the main methods used for registering services:

### 1. AddSingleton
**Lifetime**: Singleton services are created the first time they are requested and then every subsequent request will use the same instance.

**Use Case**: Use this for stateless services, configuration data, or services that should be shared across the application.

**Example**:
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();
}
```

### 2. AddScoped
**Lifetime**: Scoped services are created once per request (or per connection in the case of SignalR).

**Use Case**: Use this for services that need to be shared within a single request but not across multiple requests.

**Example**:
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();
}
```

### 3. AddTransient
**Lifetime**: Transient services are created each time they are requested. This is suitable for lightweight, stateless services.

**Use Case**: Use this for services that are inexpensive to create and donâ€™t need to maintain any state between requests.

**Example**:
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();
}
```

### Summary Table

| Method       | Lifetime                             | Use Case                                        | Example                                                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| AddSingleton | Singleton - One instance throughout the application's lifetime. | Stateless services, configuration data.        | `services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();`            |
| AddScoped    | Scoped - One instance per request.  | Services that need to be shared within a single request. | `services.AddScoped<IMyService, MyService>();`               |
| AddTransient | Transient - New instance every time. | Lightweight, stateless services.                | `services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();`           |

These methods help manage the lifecycle of your services efficiently, ensuring that you have the right instance available at the right time. Would you like more detailed examples or further explanations on any of these methods? ðŸš€ðŸ’¡ðŸ“‹
