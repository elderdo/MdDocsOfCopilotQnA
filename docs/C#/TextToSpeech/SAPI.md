### question
What NUGET package goes with SpVoice for Text to Speech?  Can you show me an example that uses it?

### answer
Certainly! If you're looking for a NuGet package to perform text-to-speech (TTS) in a .NET application, there are several options available. Let me provide you with a couple of packages and an example using one of them:

1. **Xam.Plugins.TextToSpeech**:
   - This package is suitable for Xamarin and Windows applications and allows you to perform text-to-speech functionality.
   - You can install it via NuGet using the following command:
     ```
     Install-Package Xam.Plugins.TextToSpeech
     ```
   - Here's a basic example of how to use it in a Xamarin.Forms application:

     ```csharp
     using Plugin.TextToSpeech;
     using System;
     using Xamarin.Forms;

     namespace TextToSpeech
     {
         public partial class MainPage : ContentPage
         {
             public MainPage()
             {
                 InitializeComponent();
             }

             private void ClickedButton(object sender, EventArgs args)
             {
                 var text = Enter.Text;
                 CrossTextToSpeech.Current.Speak(text);
             }
         }
     }
     ```

     In this example, when you enter text and click the "Speak" button, the app will read the provided text aloud‚Å∏.

2. **System.Speech**:
   - If you're working with Windows-specific applications, you can use the `System.Speech` package.
   - Install it via NuGet with the following command:
     ```
     Install-Package System.Speech
     ```
   - Here's a simple example using `System.Speech.Synthesis`:

     ```csharp
     using System.Speech.Synthesis;

     namespace TextToSpeechExample
     {
         class Program
         {
             static void Main(string[] args)
             {
                 var synthesizer = new SpeechSynthesizer();
                 synthesizer.Speak("Hello, world!");
             }
         }
     }
     ```

     When you run this console application, it will speak the phrase "Hello, world!"‚Å¥.

Remember to choose the package that best fits your platform and requirements. Happy coding! üòä
