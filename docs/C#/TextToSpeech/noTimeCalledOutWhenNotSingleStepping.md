### question
For this class:

namespace DigitalClock;

public partial class DigitalClockForm : Form
{
    private static System.Timers.Timer aTimer = null;
    private SpVoice speech ;
    private int speechRate = 1; // Ranges from -10 to 10 
    private int volume = 75; // Range from 0 to 100.
    private bool paused = false;
    private const int DavidVoice = 0;
    private const int ZiraVoice = 1;

    public DigitalClockForm() : this(new SpVoice())
    {
    }
    public DigitalClockForm(SpVoice speech)
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        this.speech = speech;
        this.speech.Rate = speechRate;
        this.speech.Volume = volume;
        //this.speech.Pause();
        this.speech.GetVoices(string.Empty, string.Empty)?.Item(ZiraVoice);
    }
    public void OnTimedEvent(object source, ElapsedEventArgs e)
    {
        var date = DateTime.Now;
        int hr = date.Hour;
        if (hr > 12) hr = hr - 12;
        var AmPm = date.ToString("tt");
        this.speech.Speak($"{hr} {AmPm[0]} {AmPm[1]}", SpeechVoiceSpeakFlags.SVSFlagsAsync);
        System.Media.SystemSounds.Asterisk.Play();
    }

    private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        var area = Screen.AllScreens.Length > 1 ?  Screen.AllScreens[0].WorkingArea : Screen.PrimaryScreen.WorkingArea;
        //this.Location = new Point(area.X + (area.Width / 2) - (Size.Width / 2), (area.Top));
        aTimer = new System.Timers.Timer(60 * 60 * 1000); // One hour in milliseconds
        aTimer.Elapsed += OnTimedEvent;
        aTimer.AutoReset = true; // Set AutoReset to true so the timer will automatically restart
        aTimer.Start();
        timer1.Start();
    }

    private void timer1_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        label1.Text = DateTime.Now.ToString("hh:mm tt");
    }


}
and
public class DigitalClockFormTests
{
    [TestMethod]
    public void OnTimedEvent_SpeaksCorrectTime()
    {
        // Arrange
        var form = new DigitalClockForm();
        var expectedText = DateTime.Now.ToString("hh tt");

        // Act
        form.OnTimedEvent(null, null);

        // Assert
        // You can add your own assertions here based on your specific requirements.
        // For example, check if the speech engine actually spoke the expected text.
        // You might need to mock the SpVoice class or use a test double.
    }

    [TestMethod]
    public void OnTimedEvent_SpeaksCorrectTime_WithMock()
    {
        // Arrange
        var mockSpVoice = new Mock<SpVoice>();
        var hr = DateTime.Now.Hour;
        if (hr > 12) hr = hr - 12;
        var AMPM = DateTime.Now.ToString("tt");
        var expectedText = $"{hr} {AMPM[0]} {AMPM[1]}";
        var form = new DigitalClockForm(mockSpVoice.Object);

        // Act
        form.OnTimedEvent(null, null);

        // Assert
        mockSpVoice.Verify(v => v.Speak(expectedText, SpeechVoiceSpeakFlags.SVSFlagsAsync), Times.Once);
    }

}

If I run all tests  in the debugger and step through the code line by line I will hear the time called out when OnTimedEvent_SpeaksCorrectTime is executed and the method OnTimedEvent invokes the Speak method for SpVoice.  However, I don't hear any time called out when I run the same unit test method without using the debugger.  I will only hear the sound from  System.Media.SystemSounds.Asterisk.Play().  Why does the Speak method not produce the time called out when running at a normal speed and not single stepping through the code?

### answer
The issue you're experiencing with the `Speak` method not producing the time called out when running the unit test without the debugger might be related to the asynchronous nature of the `Speak` method. Let's explore a few possibilities:

1. **Timing and Asynchronicity**:
   - When you run the code in the debugger and single-step through it, the timing might be different compared to running it normally. The `Speak` method is asynchronous, which means it doesn't block the execution of subsequent code. If the test completes before the speech finishes, you might not hear the spoken time.
   - Ensure that the test waits for the `Speak` method to complete before asserting the result. You can use synchronization mechanisms (e.g., `Task.Wait`, `Thread.Sleep`, or async/await) to ensure proper timing.

2. **Test Environment Differences**:
   - When running tests without the debugger, the environment might behave differently. For example, the audio output might not be available or configured as expected.
   - Check if the test environment has the necessary audio devices enabled and properly configured.

3. **Mocking the SpVoice Class**:
   - In your second test method (`OnTimedEvent_SpeaksCorrectTime_WithMock`), you're using a mock (`Mock<SpVoice>`) for testing. Ensure that the mock is correctly set up to simulate the behavior of the `Speak` method.
   - Verify that the mock's `Speak` method is being called with the expected arguments (`expectedText` and `SpeechVoiceSpeakFlags.SVSFlagsAsync`).

4. **Debugging the Mock Behavior**:
   - Debug the test by adding logging or breakpoints within the mock's `Speak` method (if possible). This will help you verify whether the mock is being invoked as expected.
   - Ensure that the mock's behavior matches the actual `SpVoice` behavior.

5. **Exception Handling**:
   - Check if any exceptions are thrown during the `Speak` method execution. Exceptions might be suppressed or handled differently when running without the debugger.
   - Inspect the exception details (if any) to identify potential issues.

Remember to thoroughly review your test setup, including the mock configuration and synchronization points. By addressing these aspects, you should be able to troubleshoot the issue and ensure consistent behavior between debugging and normal execution. If you encounter any specific error messages or unexpected behavior, feel free to provide additional details for further assistance.

### question
For this method:
    public  OnTimedEvent(object source, ElapsedEventArgs e)
    {
        var date = DateTime.Now;
        int hr = date.Hour;
        if (hr > 12) hr = hr - 12;
        var AmPm = date.ToString("tt");
        await this.speech.Speak($"{hr} {AmPm[0]} {AmPm[1]}", SpeechVoiceSpeakFlags.SVSFlagsAsync);
        System.Media.SystemSounds.Asterisk.Play();
    }

How do I implement using Task.Wait, Thread.Sleep or async/await to ensure the Speak method completes?  Can you show me the code?

### answer
Certainly! To ensure that the `Speak` method completes before proceeding to the next line of code, you can use `async/await`. Here's how you can modify your `OnTimedEvent` method:

```csharp
public async void OnTimedEvent(object source, ElapsedEventArgs e)
{
    var date = DateTime.Now;
    int hr = date.Hour;
    if (hr > 12) hr = hr - 12;
    var AmPm = date.ToString("tt");

    // Use async/await to wait for the Speak method to finish
    await this.speech.Speak($"{hr} {AmPm[0]} {AmPm[1]}", SpeechVoiceSpeakFlags.SVSFlagsAsync);

    // Now play the system sound
    System.Media.SystemSounds.Asterisk.Play();
}
```

By marking the method as `async` and using `await`, you ensure that the `Speak` method completes its execution before moving on to the next line of code. This way, the spoken time will be fully processed before playing the system sound. Remember to handle any exceptions that might occur during the `Speak` operation as well. 🎤🕰️

### question
When I tried:
    public async void  OnTimedEvent(object source, ElapsedEventArgs e)
    {
        var date = DateTime.Now;
        int hr = date.Hour;
        if (hr > 12) hr = hr - 12;
        var AmPm = date.ToString("tt");
        await this.speech.Speak($"{hr} {AmPm[0]} {AmPm[1]}", SpeechVoiceSpeakFlags.SVSFlagsAsync);
        System.Media.SystemSounds.Asterisk.Play();
    }

I get this compile error:
Error (active)	CS1061	'int' does not contain a definition for 'GetAwaiter' and no accessible extension method 'GetAwaiter' accepting a first argument of type 'int' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)	MVC-View	C:\Users\Douglas\Documents\C#\DigitalClock\MVC-View\DigitalClockForm.cs	32	
for this line of code:
await this.speech.Speak($"{hr} {AmPm[0]} {AmPm[1]}", SpeechVoiceSpeakFlags.SVSFlagsAsync);

What does that indicate and what is the solution to make the Speak work correctly?	

### answer
The error message you're encountering indicates that the `Speak` method is not returning an awaitable task, which is why you're unable to use `await` with it. To resolve this issue, you can use a different approach to wait for the speech synthesis to complete.

Here's how you can modify your code to ensure that the `Speak` method completes before proceeding:

```csharp
public async void OnTimedEvent(object source, ElapsedEventArgs e)
{
    var date = DateTime.Now;
    int hr = date.Hour;
    if (hr > 12) hr = hr - 12;
    var AmPm = date.ToString("tt");

    // Create a SpeechSynthesizer instance
    using (var synth = new SpeechSynthesizer())
    {
        // Synthesize the text
        var voiceStream = await synth.SynthesizeTextToStreamAsync($"{hr} {AmPm[0]} {AmPm[1]}");

        // Play the synthesized audio
        var mediaElement = new MediaElement();
        mediaElement.SetSource(voiceStream, voiceStream.ContentType);
        mediaElement.AutoPlay = false;
        mediaElement.Volume = 1;
        mediaElement.IsMuted = false;

        // Subscribe to the MediaEnded event to know when playback completes
        var tsc = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();
        mediaElement.MediaEnded += (o, args) => tsc.TrySetResult(true);

        // Start playback
        mediaElement.Play();

        // Wait for playback to complete
        await tsc.Task;
    }

    // Now play the system sound
    System.Media.SystemSounds.Asterisk.Play();
}
```

In this modified code:
- We create a `SpeechSynthesizer` instance and synthesize the text.
- We use a `MediaElement` to play the synthesized audio.
- We subscribe to the `MediaEnded` event to know when playback completes.
- We use a `TaskCompletionSource` to await the completion of audio playback.

This approach ensures that the `Speak` operation completes before playing the system sound. 🎤🕰️
