Yes, both ASP.NET and WinForms can be used to implement video chat with screen sharing, but they each have their strengths and weaknesses.

### ASP.NET
ASP.NET is a great choice for web-based applications. It can be combined with frameworks like **Angular** and services like **Twilio Programmable Video** to create a robust video chat application. Here's a [tutorial](https://developer.vonage.com/en/blog/create-a-basic-video-chat-app-with-asp-net-and-angular-dr) that walks you through creating a basic video chat app with ASP.NET and Angular.

### WinForms
WinForms is more suited for desktop applications. It can be used with libraries like **RDP API** for screen sharing. Here's a [tutorial](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/ulricht/how-to-create-a-simple-screen-sharing-application-in-C-Sharp/) on creating a simple screen sharing application in C# using WinForms.

### GitHub Projects
There are several GitHub projects that can help you get started:
- **[mirotalk](https://github.com/topics/screensharing)**: A WebRTC-based video conferencing application.
- **[Connectly](https://github.com/IshuAndani/Connectly)**: A feature-rich video conferencing application built with WebRTC and the MERN stack.
- **[ScreencastR](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/screencastr-simple-screen-sharing-app-using-signalr-streaming/)**: A simple screen sharing app using SignalR streaming.
