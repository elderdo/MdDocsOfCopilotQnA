### question

What is a good C# data type to collect column data for a row? Is a simple arracy good enough or should I use a better aggregate? I want to be able to check when all the columns have been added so I can use that data to insert a row into a table.

### answer

Using a simple array can work, but there are more flexible and powerful options in C# for collecting column data for a row. Here are a few alternatives:

1. **List<T>**: A `List<T>` is more flexible than an array and allows dynamic resizing. You can easily add and remove elements.

   ```csharp
   List<object> rowData = new List<object>();
   rowData.Add(columnValue);
   ```

2. **Dictionary<TKey, TValue>**: A `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` allows you to store key-value pairs, which can be useful if you want to associate column names with their values.

   ```csharp
   Dictionary<string, object> rowData = new Dictionary<string, object>();
   rowData["ColumnName"] = columnValue;
   ```

3. **DataRow**: If you're working with `DataTable`, a `DataRow` is specifically designed for this purpose.

   ```csharp
   DataTable table = new DataTable();
   DataRow row = table.NewRow();
   row["ColumnName"] = columnValue;
   ```

4. **Custom Class**: You can create a custom class to represent a row, with properties for each column.

   ```csharp
   public class RowData
   {
       public int Column1 { get; set; }
       public string Column2 { get; set; }
       // Add more properties as needed
   }

   RowData rowData = new RowData();
   rowData.Column1 = columnValue1;
   rowData.Column2 = columnValue2;
   ```

Using these options, you can easily check when all columns have been added and then use the data to insert a row into a table. Which option do you think would work best for your scenario?
