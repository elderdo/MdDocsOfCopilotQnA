### question

Should any appsettings file be located at the project's root folder? What it they are in a Configurations folder?

### answer

In ASP.NET Core projects, the `appsettings.json` file is typically located in the root folder of the projectÂ². This is the default location where the framework expects to find it.

However, if you prefer to place your `appsettings.json` file in a different folder, such as a `Configurations` folder, you can do so. You'll need to update your `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs` file to specify the new location. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
    }

    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureAppConfiguration((context, config) =>
            {
                config.AddJsonFile("Configurations/appsettings.json", optional: false, reloadOnChange: true);
            })
            .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
            {
                webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
            });
}
```

This way, the application will look for the `appsettings.json` file in the `Configurations` folder instead of the root folder.
