### question

For .NET 8 aren't the appsettings.json and the secrets.json along with command line arguments and environment variables already predefined with their precedence. So, is adding them required or if only they are being overridden?

### answer

You're correct! In .NET 8, the configuration sources such as `appsettings.json`, `secrets.json`, command line arguments, and environment variables are predefined with their precedence. The order of precedence is as follows:

1. Command-line arguments
2. Environment variables
3. User secrets (in development)
4. `appsettings.json`
5. `appsettings.{Environment}.json`

You only need to add them explicitly if you want to override the default behavior or add additional configuration sources. If you're just using the predefined sources, you don't need to add them manually unless you need to customize the configuration loading process.

Here's an example of how you can override the default behavior if needed:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add custom configuration sources if needed
builder.Configuration
    .AddJsonFile("customsettings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true)
    .AddEnvironmentVariables()
    .AddCommandLine(args);

var app = builder.Build();
```

In most cases, the predefined configuration sources and their precedence should be sufficient for typical applications.
