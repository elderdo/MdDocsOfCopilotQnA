### question

Where should this class with this constructor be registered and what gaurantees that the appSettings and configuration get injected to it? Can you show an example?
public DatabaseService(IOptions<AppSettings> appSettings, IConfiguration configuration)

### answer

To ensure that `DatabaseService` is properly registered and that `AppSettings` and `IConfiguration` are injected into it, you need to configure dependency injection in your `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs` file. Here's an example:

### Step 1: Configure `AppSettings` in `appsettings.json`

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "JitOperDb": "YourConnectionStringHere"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Register Services in `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
    }

    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Register AppSettings
        services.Configure<AppSettings>(Configuration.GetSection("ConnectionStrings"));

        // Register DatabaseService
        services.AddSingleton<DatabaseService>();

        // Other service registrations...
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        // Middleware configuration...
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Inject `DatabaseService` into a Controller or Another Service

```csharp
public class MyController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly DatabaseService _databaseService;

    public MyController(DatabaseService databaseService)
    {
        _databaseService = databaseService;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult Get()
    {
        // Use _databaseService here...
        return Ok();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Configure `AppSettings`**: The `appsettings.json` file contains the connection string.
2. **Register Services**: In the `ConfigureServices` method, `AppSettings` is registered using `services.Configure<AppSettings>`. The `DatabaseService` is registered as a singleton.
3. **Inject `DatabaseService`**: The `DatabaseService` is injected into a controller or another service, ensuring that `AppSettings` and `IConfiguration` are provided.

By following these steps, you ensure that `AppSettings` and `IConfiguration` are correctly injected into `DatabaseService`.
