### question
If I have a class of constants what is the best way to quickly convert that to get the values from appsettings instead of being const?

### answer
To convert a class of constants to use values from `appsettings.json` instead of being constant values, you can follow these steps:

### Steps to Convert Constants to Configuration Values

1. **Define Configuration Settings in appsettings.json**:
   - Add your settings to the `appsettings.json` file.

   ```json
   {
       "MySettings": {
           "ConstantValue1": "Value1",
           "ConstantValue2": "Value2",
           "ConstantValue3": "Value3"
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Create a Configuration Class**:
   - Create a class to represent your settings. This class should have properties that correspond to the settings in `appsettings.json`.

   ```csharp
   public class MySettings
   {
       public string ConstantValue1 { get; set; }
       public string ConstantValue2 { get; set; }
       public string ConstantValue3 { get; set; }
   }
   ```

3. **Bind Configuration to the Class**:
   - In your `Startup.cs` (or `Program.cs` in ASP.NET Core 6.0 and later), bind the configuration section to your settings class.

   ```csharp
   public class Startup
   {
       public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

       public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
       {
           Configuration = configuration;
       }

       public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
       {
           services.Configure<MySettings>(Configuration.GetSection("MySettings"));
           services.AddControllersWithViews();
       }

       public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
       {
           // Other configurations
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Inject the Configuration Class**:
   - Inject the configuration class into your controllers or services where you need to use these values.

   ```csharp
   public class MyController : Controller
   {
       private readonly MySettings _mySettings;

       public MyController(IOptions<MySettings> mySettings)
       {
           _mySettings = mySettings.Value;
       }

       public IActionResult Index()
       {
           string value1 = _mySettings.ConstantValue1;
           string value2 = _mySettings.ConstantValue2;
           string value3 = _mySettings.ConstantValue3;
           
           // Use these values as needed
           
           return View();
       }
   }
   ```

### Summary

1. **Add your configuration settings to `appsettings.json`**.
2. **Create a configuration class** to represent these settings.
3. **Bind the configuration section** to the class in `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs`.
4. **Inject the configuration class** into your controllers or services.

This approach makes your application more flexible and easier to configure without changing the code. It also supports better practices for managing application settings in different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).
