### question

What is the best class structure for my Appsettings that should contain my XmlFilePath and my ConnectionStrings which will come from my secrets.json so they are not part of the git repository?

### answer

To manage your `appsettings` and secrets in a C# .NET 8 application, you can follow this structure:

### AppSettings Class

Create a class to represent your settings:

```csharp
public class AppSettings
{
    public string XmlFilePath { get; set; }
    public ConnectionStrings ConnectionStrings { get; set; }
}

public class ConnectionStrings
{
    public string DefaultConnection { get; set; }
}
```

### appsettings.json

Define your settings in `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "AppSettings": {
    "XmlFilePath": "path/to/your/xmlfile.xml"
  }
}
```

### secrets.json

Store sensitive information like connection strings in `secrets.json`:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Your_Connection_String"
  }
}
```

### Program.cs

Load the settings and secrets in your `Program.cs`:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Load appsettings.json
builder.Configuration.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: false, reloadOnChange: true);

// Load secrets.json
builder.Configuration.AddUserSecrets<Program>();

// Bind settings to AppSettings class
builder.Services.Configure<AppSettings>(builder.Configuration.GetSection("AppSettings"));

var app = builder.Build();
```

### Usage in Code

Inject `IOptions<AppSettings>` to access the settings:

```csharp
public class SomeService
{
    private readonly AppSettings _settings;

    public SomeService(IOptions<AppSettings> settings)
    {
        _settings = settings.Value;
    }

    public void DoSomething()
    {
        var xmlFilePath = _settings.XmlFilePath;
        var connectionString = _settings.ConnectionStrings.DefaultConnection;
        // Use the settings
    }
}
```

This structure ensures that your sensitive information is kept out of your source control and is securely managed using `secrets.json`⁶⁷⁹.
