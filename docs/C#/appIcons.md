### answer

To add an icon to your C# .NET 9 console application so that it gets displayed on the taskbar when executed, follow these steps:

1. **Create or obtain an icon file** (`.ico` format) that you want to use for your application.

2. **Add the icon file to your project**:

   - In Solution Explorer, right-click your project (not the solution) and select **Add > Existing Item**.
   - Browse to the location of your icon file and add it to your project.

3. **Set the icon in the project properties**:

   - In Solution Explorer, right-click your project and select **Properties**.
   - Go to the **Application** tab.
   - In the **Icon and manifest** section, click the **Browse** button next to the **Icon** field.
   - Select the icon file you added to your project.

4. **Save and build your project**.

This will set the icon for your application, and it should be displayed on the taskbar when the application is executed¹.
