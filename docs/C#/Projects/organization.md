### question

When you need to organize classes associated with db tables what folder do you put them in?

### answer

When organizing classes associated with database tables, it's common to place them in a folder named `Models` or `Entities`. This helps keep your project structure clean and makes it easier to locate these classes. Here's a typical structure:

```
- ProjectRoot
  - Controllers
  - Views
  - Models (or Entities)
    - YourClass1.cs
    - YourClass2.cs
  - Services
  - Repositories
  - ...
```
