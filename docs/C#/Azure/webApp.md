### question
Can you show some github repo's that use a C# web app that is dockerized for Azure deployment?

### answer
Here are some GitHub repositories that feature C# web applications dockerized for Azure deployment:

1. **Azure/webapps-deploy**: This repository contains a GitHub Action for deploying to an Azure WebApp (Windows or Linux). It supports deploying a folder, *.jar, *.war, and *.zip files, and can also deploy customized images into an Azure WebApps container³.

2. **Azure-Samples/app-service-dotnet-configure-deployment-sources-for-web-apps**: This sample demonstrates how to create and deploy multiple web apps under the same app service plan using various methods, including GitHub repository with continuous integration⁴.

3. **Deploying .NET to Azure App Service**: This guide explains how to use GitHub Actions to build and deploy a .NET project to Azure App Service. It includes steps for creating an Azure App Service plan, web app, and configuring deployment credentials¹.

4. **Configure CI/CD with GitHub Actions - Azure App Service**: This documentation provides a detailed guide on setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions for Azure App Service, including manual setup and using the Deployment Center².

These resources should help you get started with deploying a C# web app to Azure using Docker.
