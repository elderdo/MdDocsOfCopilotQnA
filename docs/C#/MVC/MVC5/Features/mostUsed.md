### question
What is the most used feature of MVC 5? Can you give me some examples?

### answer
One of the most used features of ASP.NET MVC 5 is **Attribute Routing**. This feature allows you to define routes directly on your action methods and controllers using attributes, which makes routing more intuitive and readable compared to the traditional convention-based routing.

### Example of Attribute Routing

#### Basic Attribute Routing
You can apply attribute routing by adding the `[Route]` attribute to your controller actions.

```csharp
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ProductsController : Controller
{
    [HttpGet]
    [Route("all")]
    public ActionResult<IEnumerable<Product>> GetAllProducts()
    {
        // Logic to get all products
        return View();
    }
    
    [HttpGet]
    [Route("details/{id}")]
    public ActionResult<Product> GetProductDetails(int id)
    {
        // Logic to get product details by id
        return View();
    }
}
```

### Features and Examples

1. **Route Prefixes**
   - Use `[RoutePrefix]` to define a common prefix for all routes in a controller.

   ```csharp
   [RoutePrefix("api/products")]
   public class ProductsController : Controller
   {
       [HttpGet]
       [Route("")]
       public ActionResult<IEnumerable<Product>> GetAllProducts()
       {
           // Logic to get all products
           return View();
       }
       
       [HttpGet]
       [Route("{id}")]
       public ActionResult<Product> GetProductDetails(int id)
       {
           // Logic to get product details by id
           return View();
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Route Constraints**
   - You can add constraints to your routes to ensure that the parameters match certain patterns.

   ```csharp
   [RoutePrefix("api/products")]
   public class ProductsController : Controller
   {
       [HttpGet]
       [Route("{id:int:min(1)}")]
       public ActionResult<Product> GetProductDetails(int id)
       {
           // Logic to get product details by id
           return View();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Custom Route Names**
   - Assign custom names to routes using the `Name` property, which helps in generating URLs.

   ```csharp
   [RoutePrefix("api/products")]
   public class ProductsController : Controller
   {
       [HttpGet]
       [Route("", Name = "GetAllProducts")]
       public ActionResult<IEnumerable<Product>> GetAllProducts()
       {
           // Logic to get all products
           return View();
       }
       
       [HttpGet]
       [Route("{id}", Name = "GetProductDetails")]
       public ActionResult<Product> GetProductDetails(int id)
       {
           // Logic to get product details by id
           return View();
       }
   }
   ```

### Summary

Attribute routing is highly favored in ASP.NET MVC 5 for its simplicity and clarity. By allowing developers to define routes directly on action methods and controllers, it promotes clean and maintainable code. This feature is particularly useful for creating RESTful APIs and applications with complex routing requirements.
