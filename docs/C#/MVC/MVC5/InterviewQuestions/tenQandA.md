### Typical Interview Questions and Answers for ASP.NET MVC 5

Here are some common interview questions along with brief answers:

1. **What is the MVC pattern?**
   - **Answer**: MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. It is a design pattern that separates an application into three main components: Model (data), View (UI), and Controller (logic). This separation helps manage complex applications and facilitates testability and maintainability.

2. **Explain the role of the `Controller` in MVC.**
   - **Answer**: The Controller handles user input and interactions. It processes incoming requests, performs business logic, and returns the appropriate view or result. It acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.

3. **What is Razor?**
   - **Answer**: Razor is a view engine for ASP.NET MVC that allows embedding server-side code into HTML markup using C# or VB.NET. Razor syntax is concise and easy to learn, enabling developers to create dynamic web pages efficiently.

4. **What is routing in MVC?**
   - **Answer**: Routing is the process of mapping URLs to controller actions. ASP.NET MVC uses a routing table to define routes that determine how URLs are handled. Routing can be convention-based or attribute-based.

5. **How do you implement authentication in MVC 5?**
   - **Answer**: Authentication in MVC 5 can be implemented using ASP.NET Identity. This involves configuring the Identity framework, setting up user and role management, and applying authentication filters to protect actions and controllers.

6. **What are Action Filters in MVC?**
   - **Answer**: Action Filters are attributes that can be applied to controller actions or entire controllers to execute code before or after an action method runs. Common action filters include `Authorize`, `HandleError`, and custom filters for logging or caching.

7. **Explain the difference between `ViewBag`, `ViewData`, and `TempData`.**
   - **Answer**: `ViewBag` and `ViewData` are used to pass data from controllers to views. `ViewBag` is a dynamic property, while `ViewData` is a dictionary. `TempData` is used to pass data between actions, storing data temporarily during the redirection process.

8. **How do you handle exceptions in MVC 5?**
   - **Answer**: Exceptions in MVC 5 can be handled using the `HandleError` attribute, custom error pages, or global exception handling via the `Application_Error` method in `Global.asax`. Logging frameworks like NLog or Serilog can also be used for error logging.

9. **What is the use of `Bundling` and `Minification` in MVC?**
   - **Answer**: Bundling combines multiple CSS or JavaScript files into a single file to reduce the number of requests sent to the server. Minification removes unnecessary characters from these files to decrease their size. Both techniques improve page load performance.

10. **What are `Areas` in MVC?**
    - **Answer**: Areas are a way to organize large MVC applications into smaller functional groups. Each Area has its own set of controllers, views, and models, enabling better management of complex applications by dividing them into manageable sections.
