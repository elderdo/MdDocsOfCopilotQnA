### question
Is the ViewBag still used with ASP.Net Core ? Can you give me an example application, tutorial, or github repo that uses the ViewBag and its related classes?

### answer
Yes, the `ViewBag` is still used in ASP.NET Core MVC. It's a dynamic property that allows you to pass data from a controller to a view ViewBag in Asp.Net Core MVC | Asp.Net Core tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbw50yMD3q0). However, it's worth noting that while `ViewBag` is convenient for passing small amounts of data, it doesn't provide compile-time type checking, which can lead to runtime errors if property names are mistyped.

Here are some resources that might help you understand and see `ViewBag` in action:

1. **Dot Net Tutorials - ViewBag in ASP.NET Core MVC**: This tutorial provides a detailed explanation of how to use `ViewBag` in ASP.NET Core MVC with examples. You can find it [here](https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/viewbag-asp-net-core-mvc/).
2. **TekTutorialsHub - ViewBag and ViewData in ASP.NET Core**: This tutorial compares `ViewBag` and `ViewData` and shows how to use them to pass data to views. Check it out [here](https://www.tektutorialshub.com/asp-net-core/asp-net-core-viewbag-viewdata/).
3. **YouTube Video - ViewBag in ASP.NET Core MVC**: This video tutorial explains how to use `ViewBag` to pass data from the controller to the view ViewBag in Asp.Net Core MVC | Asp.Net Core tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbw50yMD3q0). Watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbw50yMD3q0) ViewBag in Asp.Net Core MVC | Asp.Net Core tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbw50yMD3q0).

Unfortunately, I couldn't find a specific GitHub repository that focuses solely on `ViewBag`, but you can create your own project and use the resources above to implement `ViewBag` in your application.

Would you like more information on any of these resources?
