### question
For an ASP.NET Core MVC app can you are ViewBag classes used? If they are can you direct me to some examples of their use - a GitHub repo, YouTube tutorial, or Web Blog would be great.

### answer
Yes, you can use `ViewBag` in ASP.NET Core MVC applications! `ViewBag` is a dynamic property that allows you to pass data from a controller to a view. It's similar to `ViewData` but provides a more convenient way to work with dynamic properties.
