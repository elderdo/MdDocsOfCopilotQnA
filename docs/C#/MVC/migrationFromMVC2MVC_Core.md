### question
Do the majority of companies with an investment in the MVC of 2006 just develop new app vs migrating? What approach costs more in general?

### answer
Many companies face a tough decision when it comes to migrating legacy ASP.NET MVC applications to ASP.NET Core. The choice between migration and developing a new application often depends on several factors, including cost, time, and the specific needs of the business.

### **Migration**
- **Pros**: Preserves existing functionality and data, leverages previous investments, and can be less disruptive.
- **Cons**: Can be complex and time-consuming, especially for large and intricate applications. Requires thorough testing to ensure everything works correctly.

### **Developing a New Application**
- **Pros**: Allows for a fresh start with modern architecture, improved performance, and new features. Can be more cost-effective in the long run if the legacy system is outdated.
- **Cons**: Requires significant time and resources, and there's a learning curve for the new system.

### **Cost Considerations**
- **Migration Costs**: Typically involves costs for developers, testing, and potential downtime during the transition. Costs can vary widely based on the complexity of the application.
- **New Development Costs**: Includes costs for planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. While initial costs might be higher, the long-term benefits of a modern, efficient system can outweigh these expenses.

In general, **migration tends to be more cost-effective for smaller, less complex applications**, while **developing a new application might be more economical for larger, more complex systems** that require significant updates and improvements.

Ultimately, the best approach depends on the specific circumstances of each company. It's often helpful to conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis and consult with experienced developers to make an informed decision.
