### question
For a Dockerfile to use .NET 8 is this the correct FROM statement:
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0 AS base
     WORKDIR /app

### answer
To use .NET 8 in your Dockerfile, you should update the `FROM` statement to reference the correct .NET 8 image. Here's the updated `FROM` statement:

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
```

This specifies the base image for ASP.NET Core runtime for .NET 8Â².
