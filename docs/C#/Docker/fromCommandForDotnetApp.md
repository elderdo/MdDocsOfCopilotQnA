### question
Can you explain this Dockerfile statement:
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0 AS base
     WORKDIR /app

### answer
Certainly!

- **FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0 AS base**:
  - This line specifies the base image for the Docker container. It uses the ASP.NET runtime image version 5.0 from Microsoft's container registry. The `AS base` part names this stage of the build process as "base".

- **WORKDIR /app**:
  - This line sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`. Any subsequent commands will be run in this directory.

These statements set up the environment for your application to run within the Docker container. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!
