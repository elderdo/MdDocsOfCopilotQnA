### question

Should ConneectionStrings always remain as a top level section since the IConfiguration comes with a GetConnectionStrings method?

### answer

Yes, it is generally a good practice to keep ConnectionStrings as a top-level section in your configuration files. This is because the IConfiguration interface in .NET provides a convenient GetConnectionString method specifically designed to retrieve connection strings from this section. Here are some reasons why you should keep ConnectionStrings as a top-level section:

1. Convenience and Readability
   • Why: The GetConnectionString method is a built-in convenience method that simplifies the retrieval of connection strings.
   • How: By keeping ConnectionStrings at the top level, you can easily access them using configuration.GetConnectionString("MyConnectionString").
2. Consistency
   • Why: Following this convention makes your configuration files consistent with the default expectations of the .NET framework.
   • How: This consistency can make your code more readable and maintainable, especially for new developers or when sharing code across different projects.
3. Separation of Concerns
   • Why: Keeping ConnectionStrings separate from other configuration settings helps in organizing the configuration file logically.
   • How: This separation makes it easier to manage and update connection strings independently of other settings.
   Example
   Configuration File (appsettings.json)

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;"
  },
  "AppSettings": {
    "XmlFilePath": "path/to/xmlfile.xml",
    "SomeOtherSetting": "value"
  }
}
```
