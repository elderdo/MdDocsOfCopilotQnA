### question
Can you show me a UWP app how do you set the C# language level to use the latest version using Visual Studio 2022?  How do you make Visual Studio 2022 open the project file?

### answer
Certainly! Let's address both parts of your request:

1. **Setting C# Language Level in Visual Studio 2022**:
   To set the C# language level to use the latest version in Visual Studio 2022, follow these steps:

   - Open your project in Visual Studio.
   - Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer.
   - Select "Properties."
   - In the properties window, navigate to the "Build" tab.
   - Under the "Advanced" section, you'll find the "Language version" dropdown.
   - Choose the desired language version (e.g., "latest" or a specific version like "10.0").
   - Click "Apply" or "OK" to save the changes.

   You can also configure the language version globally for all projects in your solution by creating a `Directory.Build.props` file in your solution directory. Add the following setting to that file:

   ```xml
   <Project>
       <PropertyGroup>
           <LangVersion>latest</LangVersion>
       </PropertyGroup>
   </Project>
   ```

   This will ensure that all projects in your solution use the specified language version¬≤.

2. **Opening a Project File in Visual Studio 2022**:
   To open a project file in Visual Studio 2022, follow these steps:

   - Launch Visual Studio 2022.
   - Click on the "File" menu.
   - Select "Open" > "Project/Solution."
   - Navigate to the location of your project file (usually with a `.csproj` extension).
   - Select the project file and click "Open."

   Alternatively, if you've already cloned a repository from a source control system (such as GitHub), you can open a project directly from there. Use the "Clone a repository" option in the start window, and Visual Studio will guide you through the process‚Åµ.

Now you're all set! Feel free to explore and develop your UWP app using Visual Studio 2022. üòä

### question
VS 2022 creates a UWP app with the C# language level at 7.3.  I want to use global usings.  How do I change the language level?  I tried using the latest version Directory.Build.props file specifying the following:
```xml
<Project>
       <PropertyGroup>
           <LangVersion>latest</LangVersion>
       </PropertyGroup>
   </Project>
```   
but it is not working.  How do I fix this?

### answer
To enable global usings in your UWP app created with Visual Studio 2022, follow these steps:

1. **Configure Language Version**:
   - Create a `Directory.Build.props` file in your solution directory (if it doesn't already exist).
   - Add the following setting to the `Directory.Build.props` file:
     ```xml
     <Project>
         <PropertyGroup>
             <LangVersion>preview</LangVersion>
         </PropertyGroup>
     </Project>
     ```
   - This sets the language version to the latest preview version, which includes support for global usings‚Åµ.

2. **Enable Implicit Global Using Directives**:
   - In your `.csproj` file, add the following setting inside a `<PropertyGroup>`:
     ```xml
     <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
     ```
   - This enables the generation of implicit global using directives‚Å∂.

3. **Convert Existing Usings to Global Usings**:
   - If you're using ReSharper, you can use the "Convert to Global Using" refactoring:
     - Place the caret at a `using` directive or select multiple directives.
     - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` and choose "Convert to Global Using" or right-click and choose "Refactor | Convert to Global Using" from the context menu‚Å¥.
   - Alternatively, manually replace individual `using` directives with global usings in your code files:
     ```csharp
     // GlobalUsings.cs
     global using System;

     // Program.cs (no usings)
     Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
     ```

By following these steps, you'll be able to use global usings in your UWP app, improving code readability and simplifying your development process‚Å∑. Let me know if you need further assistance! üòä
