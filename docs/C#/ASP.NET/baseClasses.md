### question
for the lastest asp.net mvc & web api what is the most common base class for web api? Is it Controller or alway ApiController? Is the Controller class sufficient? Is the ApiController class still used? If it is, when should it be used?

### answer
In the latest versions of ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core, the most common base class for Web API controllers is **`ControllerBase`**. Controllers should typically derive from `ControllerBase` rather than `Controller`.

### Key Points:
- **`ControllerBase`**: This class provides the necessary functionality for handling HTTP requests and is specifically designed for Web API controllers. It includes methods and properties useful for handling HTTP requests, such as `BadRequest`, `NotFound`, and `CreatedAtAction`.
- **`Controller`**: This class inherits from `ControllerBase` and adds support for views, making it suitable for handling both web pages and web API requests. However, if your controller is solely focused on Web API functionality, `ControllerBase` is the preferred choice.

### When to Use `ApiController`:
- **ApiController**: This attribute is used to mark a class as a Web API controller. It's not a base class but an attribute that you apply to your controller class. It provides additional features like automatic model validation and response formatting.

### Summary:
- **For Web API controllers**: Use `ControllerBase` as the base class.
- **For controllers that handle both web pages and Web API requests**: Use `Controller`.
- **To mark a class as a Web API controller**: Use the `ApiController` attribute.

### question
Is the ApiController class used very much still?

### answer
The `ApiController` class is not commonly used in ASP.NET Core. In ASP.NET Core, the recommended approach for building Web APIs is to derive your controllers from `ControllerBase` and use the `[ApiController]` attribute to mark the controller as a Web API controller.

### ASP.NET Core Recommendations:
- **Base Class**: Use `ControllerBase` as the base class for your Web API controllers.
- **Attribute**: Use the `[ApiController]` attribute to enable features such as automatic model validation and response formatting.

### Example of ASP.NET Core Web API Controller:
```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class TestDataController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IActionResult GetTestData()
    {
        var testData = new
        {
            Id = 1,
            Name = "Test Data",
            Description = "This is a test data endpoint."
        };
        return Ok(testData);
    }
}
```

### Features Enabled by `[ApiController]` Attribute:
- **Automatic Model Validation**: Automatically returns a `400 Bad Request` response if the model state is invalid.
- **Binding Source Parameter Inference**: Automatically infers binding sources for action parameters.
- **Problem Details Response**: Provides detailed problem responses for error status codes.

### Summary:
- **`ApiController` Class**: Used in older versions of ASP.NET Web API (ASP.NET Framework).
- **`ControllerBase`**: Preferred base class for Web API controllers in ASP.NET Core.
- **`[ApiController]` Attribute**: Recommended for ASP.NET Core Web API controllers to enable enhanced features.

By following these recommendations, you can leverage the latest features and best practices for building Web APIs in ASP.NET Core.
