### Main Features of ASP.NET

1. **High Performance**: ASP.NET is known for its high performance, thanks to its use of the Kestrel web server and efficient use of asynchronous programming patterns.
2. **Cross-Platform Support**: ASP.NET Core allows you to develop and run applications on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
3. **Asynchronous Programming**: ASP.NET supports asynchronous programming with async/await, which helps in handling I/O-bound operations more efficiently.
4. **Unified MVC and Web API Frameworks**: ASP.NET Core merges MVC and Web API frameworks, providing a unified way to build web applications and services.
5. **Rich Development Environments**: Visual Studio provides a comprehensive development environment with powerful tools for debugging, testing, and deploying ASP.NET applications.
6. **Security**: ASP.NET includes built-in security features like authentication, authorization, and protection against common web vulnerabilities - InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/features-of-asp-net/).
7. **Support for Modern Web Standards**: ASP.NET supports HTML5, CSS3, and other modern web standards, allowing developers to create rich, interactive web applications - InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/features-of-asp-net/).
8. **Dependency Injection**: ASP.NET Core supports dependency injection, making it easier to manage dependencies and improve code maintainability - InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/asp-net-interview-questions/).
9. **Routing**: ASP.NET provides flexible routing options, allowing developers to define URL patterns and map them to specific controllers and actions - InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/asp-net-interview-questions/).
10. **Globalization and Localization**: ASP.NET supports globalization and localization, enabling applications to be adapted for different languages and cultures - InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/features-of-asp-net/).

### Typical Interview Questions and Answers for ASP.NET

1. **What is the difference between ASP.NET Web Forms and ASP.NET MVC?**
   - **Answer**: ASP.NET Web Forms follows an event-driven model similar to traditional Windows desktop applications, using server controls and ViewState to maintain state across postbacks. ASP.NET MVC, on the other hand, follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, promoting separation of concerns and cleaner, more modular code.

2. **What is ViewState in ASP.NET, and how does it work?**
   - **Answer**: ViewState is a mechanism in ASP.NET Web Forms that preserves the state of server controls across postbacks. It stores control state information in a hidden field on the page, allowing the server to restore the state when the page is posted back.

3. **Can you explain the difference between IIS and Kestrel?**
   - **Answer**: IIS (Internet Information Services) is a Windows-based web server, while Kestrel is a cross-platform web server used by ASP.NET Core - InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/asp-net-interview-questions/). Kestrel can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS, whereas IIS is limited to Windows - InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/asp-net-interview-questions/).

4. **What is dependency injection in ASP.NET Core, and why is it useful?**
   - **Answer**: Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows a class to receive its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them internally - InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/asp-net-interview-questions/). It promotes loose coupling, making the code more modular, testable, and maintainable - InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/asp-net-interview-questions/).

5. **How do you handle asynchronous operations in ASP.NET Core?**
   - **Answer**: Asynchronous operations in ASP.NET Core are handled using the async/await keywords. This allows the application to perform non-blocking I/O operations, improving performance and scalability.

6. **What are the benefits of using ASP.NET Core over the legacy ASP.NET framework?**
   - **Answer**: ASP.NET Core is cross-platform, high-performance, and open-source, making it more flexible and scalable compared to the legacy ASP.NET framework. It also supports modern web standards and provides better support for dependency injection and routing - InterviewBit](https://www.interviewbit.com/asp-net-interview-questions/).

These features and questions should give you a good overview of ASP.NET and help you prepare for interviews. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
