### question
What is the latest version of asp.net mvc?

### answer
The latest version of ASP.NET MVC is **5.2.8**, which was released on April 12, 2022. ASP.NET MVC is no longer in active development, as it has been succeeded by ASP.NET Core, which unifies ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, and other ASP.NET technologies into a single framework.

Would you like to know more about ASP.NET Core or how to migrate from ASP.NET MVC to ASP.NET Core?
