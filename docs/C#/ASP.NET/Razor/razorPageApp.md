### question
Is a Razor page app an MVC rolled into just one class for a simple quick app?

### answer
That's a great way to think about it! Razor Pages in ASP.NET Core simplify the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern by combining aspects of the controller and view into a single class, making it more streamlined for simple, quick apps. 

### How Razor Pages Simplify MVC

1. **PageModel Class**: In Razor Pages, each page typically has an associated `PageModel` class which acts like a controller. This class contains the logic for handling requests and managing the page's data.
2. **View**: The `.cshtml` file serves as the view, containing the HTML markup and Razor syntax to render the page.

### Comparison to MVC

- **MVC**: In the traditional MVC pattern, you have separate controllers for handling requests and views for rendering HTML.
- **Razor Pages**: Combines the controller and view into a cohesive unit, reducing the need for additional controller classes for each view.

### Example

#### Razor Page (Index.cshtml)
```html
@page
@model IndexModel

<h1>Welcome, @Model.Message!</h1>
```

#### PageModel (Index.cshtml.cs)
```csharp
public class IndexModel : PageModel
{
    public string Message { get; set; }

    public void OnGet()
    {
        Message = "Hello, World!";
    }
}
```

In this example:
- The `IndexModel` class handles the logic for the page, similar to a controller.
- The `Index.cshtml` file acts as the view, displaying the data managed by the `PageModel`.

### Summary

Razor Pages provide a simpler and more streamlined approach to building web applications, especially for smaller projects or quick apps. They encapsulate the functionality of both the controller and the view, making development more efficient while still leveraging the power of ASP.NET Core.
