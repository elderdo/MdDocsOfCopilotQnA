What are typical Razor Interview questions and their answers?

### answer

Here are some typical Razor interview questions along with their answers:

### Basic Questions

1. **What is Razor Syntax?**
   - **Answer**: Razor syntax is a markup syntax used in ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core to embed server-based code into web pages. It allows you to write C# code within HTML, making it easier to create dynamic web pages.

2. **What is the role of a Razor Engine in ASP.NET MVC?**
   - **Answer**: The Razor Engine serves as a view engine in ASP.NET MVC, enabling the creation of dynamic web pages using C# or VB.NET. It parses and compiles views into executable code, facilitating server-side rendering.

3. **How do you differentiate between Razor and ASPX view engines?**
   - **Answer**: Razor has a compact syntax, reducing the amount of typing required. It doesnâ€™t require closing tags for code blocks, making it easier to read and write. ASPX uses traditional WebForms syntax, which can be verbose and requires closing tags for all code blocks.

### Intermediate Questions

4. **Can you explain the syntax of Razor view engine with an example?**
   - **Answer**: Razor syntax uses the `@` symbol for server-side code in HTML. For example, `@DateTime.Now` will display the current date and time. You can also use control structures like loops and conditionals.

5. **What are the benefits of using Razor syntax over traditional WebForms?**
   - **Answer**: Razor syntax is more concise and readable, reducing the amount of code needed. It supports test-driven development (TDD) and doesn't depend on the `System.Web.UI.Page` class, making it more flexible.

### Advanced Questions

6. **How would you handle errors in Razor views?**
   - **Answer**: You can use `try-catch` blocks within Razor views to handle errors. Additionally, you can use the `@Html.ValidationMessageFor` helper to display validation errors from model binding.

7. **Can you explain how to use layout pages in Razor?**
   - **Answer**: Layout pages in Razor allow you to define a common structure for your views. You can use the `@RenderBody()` method to specify where the content of individual views will be rendered within the layout.
