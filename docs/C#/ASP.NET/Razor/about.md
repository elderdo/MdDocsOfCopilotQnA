### question
Is razor code only valid for cshtml files?

### answer

Razor code is predominantly used in `.cshtml` files, which are Razor View Pages in ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core applications. These files combine HTML markup with C# code to generate dynamic web content. However, there are other places where Razor syntax can be used:

### Razor View Pages (`.cshtml`)
- **Primary Use**: Razor View Pages are the most common use case for Razor syntax. These files are used to create views in MVC applications.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  @model MyApp.Models.User
  <h1>Welcome, @Model.Name!</h1>
  ```

### Razor Pages (`.cshtml`)
- **Purpose**: Introduced in ASP.NET Core, Razor Pages are a page-based programming model. Each page has its own `.cshtml` file and an accompanying `.cshtml.cs` file for the page model.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  @page
  @model MyApp.Pages.IndexModel
  <h1>Welcome to Razor Pages!</h1>
  ```

### Razor Components (`.razor`)
- **Use Case**: Razor syntax is also used in Blazor, which allows you to create interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor components are typically defined in `.razor` files.
- **Example**:
  ```razor
  @page "/counter"
  <h3>Counter</h3>
  <button @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

  @code {
      private int currentCount = 0;

      private void IncrementCount()
      {
          currentCount++;
      }
  }
  ```

### Email Templates (`.cshtml`)
- **Application**: Razor views can also be used to generate dynamic email templates, leveraging the same syntax to create the email body.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  @model MyApp.Models.EmailModel
  <p>Hello @Model.RecipientName,</p>
  <p>This is a dynamic email content example.</p>
  ```

### Summary

While `.cshtml` files are the most common use case for Razor syntax, it is also used in Razor Pages, Blazor components (`.razor` files), and even email templates. Razor provides a flexible and powerful way to create dynamic web content across different scenarios in ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core applications.
