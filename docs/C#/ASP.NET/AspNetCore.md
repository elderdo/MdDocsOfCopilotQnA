### question
In a nutshell, can you indicate how ASP.Net Core unifies ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API and explain what other technologies are associated with ASP.Net? Also, how do I migrate from ASP.Net Core from ASP.NET MVC?

### answer
Sure! ASP.NET Core is a modern, open-source framework that unifies ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Web API, and other ASP.NET technologies into a single framework, streamlining web application development.

### Unification of ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Web API

1. **Single Controller Base Class**:
   - In ASP.NET Core, both MVC and Web API controllers derive from `ControllerBase`. This unifies the way HTTP requests are handled, making it simpler to create APIs and web applications using the same framework.

2. **Unified Routing**:
   - ASP.NET Core uses a single routing system for both MVC and Web API. This means you can define routes for both controllers and APIs using the same configuration, improving consistency and reducing complexity.

3. **Dependency Injection**:
   - ASP.NET Core includes built-in dependency injection, which is used consistently across both MVC and Web API, promoting a more modular and testable codebase.

### Other Technologies Associated with ASP.NET Core

- **Razor Pages**: A simplified model for building web applications, which focuses on page-based scenarios.
- **Blazor**: A framework for building interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript.
- **SignalR**: A library for adding real-time web functionality to applications.
- **gRPC**: A high-performance RPC framework for building APIs.

### Migrating from ASP.NET MVC to ASP.NET Core

1. **Create a New ASP.NET Core Project**:
   - Open Visual Studio 2022 and create a new ASP.NET Core Web Application.

2. **Update Project Files**:
   - Migrate project configuration files (`appsettings.json`, `launchSettings.json`) and dependencies (`csproj`).

3. **Refactor Controllers and Models**:
   - Update your controllers to inherit from `ControllerBase` or `Controller`.
   - Refactor model and data access layers to use Entity Framework Core if applicable.

4. **Update Views and Razor Pages**:
   - Migrate your views to use the Razor syntax compatible with ASP.NET Core.

5. **Configure Middleware and Services**:
   - Update the `Startup.cs` file to configure services, middleware, and routing.

6. **Test and Validate**:
   - Thoroughly test your application to ensure all functionality works as expected after the migration.
