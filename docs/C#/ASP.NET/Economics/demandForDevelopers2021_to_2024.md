1. **AI and Machine Learning**: There has been a significant increase in demand for developers with skills in AI and machine learning. Job openings for AI research scientists and machine learning engineers have grown substantially.
2. **Frontend and Backend Development**: While demand for frontend and backend developers has remained strong, there has been a slight decline in job openings for these roles compared to previous years.
3. **Low-Code/No-Code Development**: The rise of low-code and no-code platforms has also influenced the demand for traditional developers, as businesses look for simpler ways to create software - Exploding Topics](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/software-development-trends).
