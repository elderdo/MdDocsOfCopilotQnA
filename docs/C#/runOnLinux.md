### question

The server is running with the Oracle Client and can easily connect with SQL*Plus.  To run my console app in a batch script what else do I need or is this a sufficient system?

### answer
Your Oracle Linux Server 7.9 setup sounds like a solid foundation1
! Since you already have the Oracle Client installed and can connect with SQL*Plus, you're off to a great start. To run your C# .NET 8 console application in a batch script, here are a few additional steps:

Install .NET 8 SDK/Runtime: Ensure you have the .NET 8 SDK and runtime installed on your server2
. You can follow the official installation guide for Linux3
Set Up Your Environment: Make sure your environment variables are correctly set up for .NET. This includes adding the .NET binaries to your PATH.

Create a Batch Script: Write a shell script to compile and run your C# application. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

Bash

Copy
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Compile the C# application
dotnet build /path/to/your/project.csproj

# Run the compiled application

dotnet /path/to/your/project.dll
```
Permissions: Ensure your script has execute permissions:

Bash

Copy
```bash
chmod +x /path/to/your/script.sh
```
Run the Script: Execute the script in your terminal:
Bash

Copy
```bash
./path/to/your/script.sh
```
This setup should be sufficient to run your C# .NET 8 console application on your Oracle Linux Server4
. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for more detailed assistance!
