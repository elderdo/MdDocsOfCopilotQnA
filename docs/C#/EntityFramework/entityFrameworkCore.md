### question
How does Entity Framework Core differ from previous versions?

### answer
Entity Framework Core (EF Core) differs from previous versions of Entity Framework (EF6 and earlier) in several key ways:

### Key Differences

1. **Cross-Platform Support**:
   - **EF Core**: Designed to work across different platforms, including .NET Core, .NET 5/6+, and Xamarin.
   - **EF6**: Limited to the .NET Framework, which is Windows-specific.

2. **Performance**:
   - **EF Core**: Optimized for better performance and reduced memory footprint.
   - **EF6**: Generally slower and more resource-intensive compared to EF Core.

3. **Modularity**:
   - **EF Core**: More modular and lightweight, allowing developers to include only the necessary components.
   - **EF6**: A monolithic framework with more dependencies and a larger footprint.

4. **Database Providers**:
   - **EF Core**: Supports a wider range of database providers through a plugin model.
   - **EF6**: Limited to SQL Server and a few other providers.

5. **New Features**:
   - **EF Core**: Includes new features such as shadow properties, global query filters, and support for many-to-many relationships without join entities.
   - **EF6**: Lacks these advanced features and focuses on stability rather than new functionality.

6. **Configuration**:
   - **EF Core**: Uses a more flexible configuration model with dependency injection and options patterns.
   - **EF6**: Relies on a more rigid configuration setup.

### Migration from EF6 to EF Core

1. **Update Project Files**:
   - Change your project to target .NET Core or .NET 5/6+.
   - Update your `csproj` file to include EF Core dependencies.

2. **Refactor DbContext**:
   - Update your `DbContext` class to inherit from `DbContext` in EF Core.
   - Replace EF6-specific configurations with EF Core configurations.

3. **Update Database Provider**:
   - Ensure you have the appropriate EF Core database provider installed for your target database.

4. **Migrate Database Schema**:
   - Use EF Core's migration tools to generate and apply migrations to update your database schema.

5. **Test and Validate**:
   - Thoroughly test your application to ensure all functionality works as expected after the migration.

### Summary

EF Core is a modern, cross-platform, and more modular version of Entity Framework, offering better performance and flexibility compared to previous versions. Migrating from EF6 to EF Core involves updating project files, refactoring `DbContext`, updating database providers, and migrating the database schema.
