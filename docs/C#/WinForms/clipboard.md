Yes, there are GitHub projects that demonstrate how to add data to the clipboard in WinForms. Here are a couple of examples:

1. **[dotnet/docs-desktop](https://github.com/dotnet/docs-desktop)**: This repository contains official Microsoft documentation, including a guide on how to retrieve and add data to the clipboard using the `System.Windows.Forms.Clipboard` class. You can find the guide [here](https://github.com/dotnet/docs-desktop/blob/main/dotnet-desktop-guide/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-retrieve-data-from-the-clipboard.md).

2. **[John-Hart/dotnetdocs](https://github.com/John-Hart/dotnetdocs)**: This repository also contains .NET documentation, including examples of clipboard operations. You can explore it [here](https://github.com/John-Hart/dotnetdocs/blob/master/docs/framework/winforms/advanced/how-to-retrieve-data-from-the-clipboard.md).

These resources should provide you with examples and guidance on how to implement clipboard functionality in your WinForms applications. If you need more specific examples or have any questions, feel free to ask!
