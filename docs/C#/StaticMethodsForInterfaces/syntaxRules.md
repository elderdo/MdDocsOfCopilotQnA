### question

What are the syntax rules for static interfaces? Do they alway require the abstract or virtual keyword?

### answer

### Syntax Rules for Static Methods in Interfaces

1. **Static Abstract Methods**:

   - Defined using the `static abstract` keywords.
   - Implementing classes must provide the static methods defined in the interface.
   - Example:

     ```csharp
     public interface ICalculator
     {
         static abstract int Add(int a, int b);
     }

     public class Calculator : ICalculator
     {
         public static int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;
     }
     ```

2. **Static Virtual Methods**:

   - Defined using the `static virtual` keywords.
   - Can have a default implementation in the interface.
   - Implementing classes can override the default implementation.
   - Example:

     ```csharp
     public interface IShape
     {
         static virtual double CalculateArea(double width, double height) => width * height;
     }

     public class Rectangle : IShape
     {
         public static double CalculateArea(double width, double height) => width * height;
     }
     ```

3. **No New Syntax for Implicit Implementation**:

   - No new syntax is needed in classes and structs to facilitate implicit implementation of static abstract interface members¹.

4. **Qualified Name for Explicit Implementation**:
   - Explicit implementations of static abstract interface members use a qualified name along with the static modifier¹.

### Key Points

- Static methods in interfaces do not always require the `abstract` or `virtual` keyword.
- Static methods can be defined without these keywords if they are not intended to be abstract or virtual.

### question

Can you show an example of a static method for an interface that does not have either abstract or virtual keywords applied to it?

### answer

Certainly! Here's an example of a static method in an interface that does not use the `abstract` or `virtual` keywords:

```csharp
public interface IUtility
{
    static int Multiply(int a, int b)
    {
        return a * b;
    }
}

public class Utility : IUtility
{
    // No need to implement the static method in the class
}

// Usage
int result = IUtility.Multiply(3, 4); // result will be 12
```

In this example, the `Multiply` method is a static method within the `IUtility` interface and does not use the `abstract` or `virtual` keywords. The method has a default implementation directly in the interface, and there is no need for the implementing class to provide its own implementation.

### question

Is an implementation always required for a static method in an interface that does not have the abstract or virtual keyword?

### answer

Yes, an implementation is always required for a static method in an interface that does not have the `abstract` or `virtual` keyword. Static methods in interfaces must have a body because they cannot be overridden or implemented by the classes that implement the interface. Here's an example:

```csharp
public interface IUtility
{
    static int Multiply(int a, int b)
    {
        return a * b;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Multiply` method has a body and provides its own implementation directly within the interface.
