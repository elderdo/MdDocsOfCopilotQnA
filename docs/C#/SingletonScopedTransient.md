### For C# and its IServiceCollection what is the difference between AddSingleton, AddScoped, and AddTransient?


In C# and its `IServiceCollection`, the difference between `AddSingleton`, `AddScoped`, and `AddTransient` lies in the service lifetime:

1. **AddSingleton**:
   - A single instance of the service is created and shared throughout the application's lifetime.
   - Every request and every service will use the same instance.
   - Suitable for stateful services.

2. **AddScoped**:
   - A new instance of the service is created once per request.
   - The same instance is used within the scope of a single HTTP request but different instances are used across different requests.
   - Suitable for services that should be unique per request but shared within the request.

3. **AddTransient**:
   - A new instance of the service is created every time it is requested.
   - Suitable for lightweight, stateless services.
   - Each request and each service gets a new instance.

Here's a quick summary:

| Lifetime    | Instance Creation                          | Suitable For                        |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Singleton   | Once for the entire application            | Stateful services                   |
| Scoped      | Once per request                           | Services unique per request         |
| Transient   | Every time it is requested                 | Lightweight, stateless services     |
