I tried to set a timer for every hour and then use the SpeechLib to call out the hour and AM or PM, but it does not call out the time for every hour.  Can you see the error and how it can be fixed?

### answer

Certainly! I noticed an issue in your code that prevents the timer from calling out the time every hour. Let's address it:

1. **Timer Initialization**: In your `Form1_Load` method, you create a timer (`aTimer`) with a one-hour interval (60 minutes). However, the `Elapsed` event handler (`OnTimedEvent`) is set to speak the time and AM/PM only once. After that initial call, the timer doesn't repeat.

2. **Recreating Timer**: Inside the `OnTimedEvent` method, you recreate the timer (`aTimer`) with the same interval (one hour). This action effectively cancels the existing timer and sets up a new one, which won't fire again until another hour has passed.

To fix this, follow these steps:

- Remove the timer recreation inside the `OnTimedEvent` method.
- Set the `AutoReset` property of the timer to `true` so that it automatically restarts after each elapsed event.

Here's the updated code snippet:

```csharp
private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // ... Other initialization code ...

    aTimer = new System.Timers.Timer(60 * 60 * 1000); // One hour in milliseconds
    aTimer.Elapsed += OnTimedEvent;
    aTimer.AutoReset = true; // Set AutoReset to true
    aTimer.Start();
    timer1.Start();
}

private void OnTimedEvent(object source, ElapsedEventArgs e)
{
    var date = DateTime.Now;
    int hr = date.Hour;
    var AmPm = date.ToString("tt");
    speech.Speak($"{hr} {AmPm[0]} {AmPm[1]}", SpeechVoiceSpeakFlags.SVSFlagsAsync);
    // System.Media.SystemSounds.Asterisk.Play();
}
```

Now the timer will call out the time every hour as expected. If you encounter any further issues, feel free to ask! üòä¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ

```
I tried to set a timer for every hour and set   aTimer.AutoReset = true; // Set AutoReset to true 
and then used the SpeechLib to call out the hour and AM or PM, but it still does not call out the time for every hour.  Can you see the error and how it can be fixed?  Can the OnTimedEvent be unit tested to make sure the text to speech is working correctly?  Can you show an example for that Unit Test?

### answeer

Certainly! Let's address the issue with your timer and then create a unit test for the `OnTimedEvent` method to ensure the text-to-speech functionality is working correctly.

1. **Timer Issue**:
   - The problem lies in recreating the timer inside the `OnTimedEvent` method. By doing so, you cancel the existing timer and set up a new one, which won't fire again until another hour has passed.
   - To fix this, remove the timer recreation inside `OnTimedEvent` and set the `AutoReset` property to `true`.

2. **Unit Test for `OnTimedEvent`**:
   - We can create a unit test using a testing framework like MSTest or NUnit. For demonstration purposes, I'll provide a simple example using MSTest.
   - We'll verify that the `OnTimedEvent` method correctly speaks the time and AM/PM.

Here's an example of how you can write a unit test for the `OnTimedEvent` method:

```csharp
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;
using SpeechLib;

namespace DigitalClock.Tests
{
    [TestClass]
    public class DigitalClockFormTests
    {
        [TestMethod]
        public void OnTimedEvent_SpeaksCorrectTime()
        {
            // Arrange
            var form = new DigitalClockForm();
            var expectedText = DateTime.Now.ToString("hh tt");

            // Act
            form.OnTimedEvent(null, null);

            // Assert
            // You can add your own assertions here based on your specific requirements.
            // For example, check if the speech engine actually spoke the expected text.
            // You might need to mock the SpVoice class or use a test double.
        }
    }
}
```

Remember to adjust the assertions in the test method based on your actual implementation and the behavior of the `SpVoice` class. You might need to use a mocking library or a test double to verify the speech output.

Feel free to adapt this example to your testing framework and requirements. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask! üòä¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥

### question
How would you mock the SpVoice class or use a test double?  Can you show an example for that Unit Test with the Mock and one with a Test double?

### answer
Certainly! Let's address the issues with your timer and then create unit tests for the `OnTimedEvent` method to ensure the text-to-speech functionality is working correctly. We'll also demonstrate how to mock the `SpVoice` class using both a mock and a test double.

1. **Timer Issue**:
   - The problem lies in recreating the timer inside the `OnTimedEvent` method. By doing so, you cancel the existing timer and set up a new one, which won't fire again until another hour has passed.
   - To fix this, remove the timer recreation inside `OnTimedEvent` and set the `AutoReset` property to `true`.

2. **Unit Testing with Mock and Test Double**:
   - We'll create two unit tests: one using a mock and another using a test double.
   - For demonstration purposes, I'll use MSTest, but you can adapt this to your preferred testing framework.

Here's an example of how you can write unit tests:

```csharp
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;
using Moq;
using SpeechLib;

namespace DigitalClock.Tests
{
    [TestClass]
    public class DigitalClockFormTests
    {
        [TestMethod]
        public void OnTimedEvent_SpeaksCorrectTime_WithMock()
        {
            // Arrange
            var mockSpVoice = new Mock<SpVoice>();
            var form = new DigitalClockForm { speech = mockSpVoice.Object };
            var expectedText = DateTime.Now.ToString("hh tt");

            // Act
            form.OnTimedEvent(null, null);

            // Assert
            mockSpVoice.Verify(v => v.Speak(expectedText, SpeechVoiceSpeakFlags.SVSFlagsAsync), Times.Once);
        }

        [TestMethod]
        public void OnTimedEvent_SpeaksCorrectTime_WithTestDouble()
        {
            // Arrange
            var testDoubleSpVoice = new TestDoubleSpVoice();
            var form = new DigitalClockForm { speech = testDoubleSpVoice };
            var expectedText = DateTime.Now.ToString("hh tt");

            // Act
            form.OnTimedEvent(null, null);

            // Assert
            Assert.AreEqual(expectedText, testDoubleSpVoice.LastSpokenText);
        }
    }

    // Test double for SpVoice
    public class TestDoubleSpVoice : SpVoice
    {
        public string LastSpokenText { get; private set; }

        public override void Speak(string text, SpeechVoiceSpeakFlags flags)
        {
            LastSpokenText = text;
        }
    }
}
```

In the first test, we use a mock (`Mock<SpVoice>`) to verify that the `Speak` method is called with the expected text. In the second test, we use a test double (`TestDoubleSpVoice`) to capture the last spoken text for assertion.

Remember to adjust the assertions in the test methods based on your actual implementation and the behavior of the `SpVoice` class. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask! üòä¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥
