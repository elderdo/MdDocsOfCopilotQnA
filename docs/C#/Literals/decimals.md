### question
What does the m represent for 1.10m ?

### answer
The `m` suffix in `1.10m` specifies that the number is of type `decimal` in C#. 

### Explanation of `decimal`

- **Decimal Type**: The `decimal` type is a 128-bit data type used for financial and monetary calculations that require a high degree of accuracy.
- **Precision**: It provides more precision than the `float` and `double` types, making it suitable for handling financial data where precision is critical.

### Example Usage

In the code snippet:
```csharp
decimal price = 1.10m;
```
- The `1.10m` represents a decimal number with a value of 1.10.
- The `m` suffix explicitly indicates that the number should be treated as a `decimal` rather than a `double` or `float`.

### Importance of Using `decimal`

- **Financial Calculations**: When dealing with monetary values, using `decimal` helps prevent rounding errors and ensures precise calculations.
- **Explicit Suffix**: Using the `m` suffix makes the code more readable and avoids implicit type conversion, which can lead to unexpected results.

By using the `m` suffix, you ensure that your financial calculations maintain the necessary precision. If you have more questions about data types or any other C# features, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ“ŠðŸ’¡
