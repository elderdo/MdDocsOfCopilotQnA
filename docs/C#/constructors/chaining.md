### question
I am not clear on the syntax of the first constructor and what the this(new SpeechSynthesizer()) works.  Can you give a more detail related to the this part following the colon which I believe indicates inheritance?  If I am incorrect about the colon, please explain what it does too.

### answer
The colon (:) in the constructor is not related to inheritance in this context. Instead, it is used to call another constructor within the same class. This is known as constructor chaining.
Here's a detailed explanation:

### Constructor Chaining
In C#, you can call one constructor from another constructor in the same class using the this keyword followed by parentheses containing the arguments to pass to the called constructor. This is useful for avoiding code duplication and ensuring that initialization logic is centralized.

### Example in Your Code
Let's break down the constructors in your DigitalClockForm class:
```csharp
public DigitalClockForm() : this(new SpeechSynthesizer())
{
}
```

•	public DigitalClockForm(): This is the default constructor.
•	: this(new SpeechSynthesizer()): This part calls the second constructor public DigitalClockForm(SpeechSynthesizer speech) and passes a new instance of SpeechSynthesizer as an argument.

So, when you create an instance of DigitalClockForm using the default constructor, it internally calls the second constructor with a new SpeechSynthesizer object.

### Second Constructor
```csharp
public DigitalClockForm(SpeechSynthesizer speech)
{
    InitializeComponent();
    this.speech = speech;
    this.speech.Rate = speechRate;
    this.speech.Volume = volume;
}
```

•	public DigitalClockForm(SpeechSynthesizer speech): This constructor accepts a SpeechSynthesizer object as a parameter.
•	InitializeComponent(): Initializes the form's components.
•	this.speech = speech: Assigns the passed SpeechSynthesizer object to the class's speech field.
•	this.speech.Rate = speechRate and this.speech.Volume = volume: Sets the speech rate and volume for the SpeechSynthesizer.

### Summary
•	The colon (:) followed by this(new SpeechSynthesizer()) in the default constructor is used to call the second constructor with a new SpeechSynthesizer instance.
•	This ensures that the SpeechSynthesizer is properly initialized and the initialization logic is centralized in one place.
