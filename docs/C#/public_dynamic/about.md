### question
When a class is described as public dynamic, what does that mean?

### answer
In C#, a class cannot be directly described as `public dynamic` because `dynamic` is a type, not an access modifier. However, you can have a public class that includes dynamic members or utilizes dynamic behavior.

### Understanding `dynamic`

- **`dynamic` Type**: The `dynamic` keyword in C# is used to bypass compile-time type checking. It allows you to create objects that can be modified at runtime without having to define their type explicitly at compile time.
- **Usage**: It is often used for interoperability with COM objects, dynamic languages, or to handle objects whose structure is determined at runtime.

### Example with `dynamic` Members

Here's an example of a public class that includes dynamic members:

```csharp
public class DynamicExample
{
    public dynamic DynamicProperty { get; set; }

    public void UseDynamic()
    {
        dynamic dynamicVar = "Hello, World!";
        Console.WriteLine(dynamicVar);

        dynamicVar = 12345;
        Console.WriteLine(dynamicVar);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Dynamic Property**: The class `DynamicExample` has a public property `DynamicProperty` of type `dynamic`. This property can hold any type of value, and its type can change at runtime.
- **Dynamic Variable**: In the method `UseDynamic`, a dynamic variable `dynamicVar` is first assigned a string value and then an integer value. Both assignments are valid because `dynamic` allows the variable to hold any type.

### Usage and Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Using `dynamic` provides flexibility, especially when dealing with data or objects that are not known until runtime.
- **Interoperability**: It is useful for interacting with dynamic languages, COM objects, and frameworks that provide dynamic objects, such as JSON serialization/deserialization.

### Considerations

- **Performance**: Using `dynamic` can introduce runtime overhead because type checking and binding are deferred until runtime.
- **Safety**: It bypasses compile-time type checking, which can lead to runtime errors if used carelessly.

By understanding the `dynamic` keyword and how it works in conjunction with public classes and members, you can leverage its flexibility while being mindful of the potential trade-offs. If you have more questions or need further examples, feel free to ask! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’¡ðŸ“‹
